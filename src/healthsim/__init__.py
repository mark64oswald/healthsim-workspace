"""HealthSim Core - Shared foundation for HealthSim product family.

This library provides generic infrastructure for building simulation
and synthetic data generation products.

Modules:
    person: Person demographics, identifiers, relationships
    temporal: Timeline management, periods, date utilities
    generation: Base generator, distributions, reproducibility
    validation: Validation framework, results, base validators
    formats: Base transformer, JSON/CSV utilities
    skills: Skill schema, loader, composer
    config: Settings management, logging
    dimensional: Analytics-ready star schema output layer
    state: Workspace persistence, provenance tracking, session management
    benefits: Benefit accumulators, cost sharing infrastructure
