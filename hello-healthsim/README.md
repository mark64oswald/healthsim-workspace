# Hello HealthSim!

**Get up and running with synthetic healthcare data generation in 5 minutes.**

HealthSim is a skill-based framework that enables Claude to generate realistic synthetic healthcare data through natural conversation. No coding required - just describe what you need.

> **⚠️ Important Notice**
>
> HealthSim generates **synthetic test data only**. It is not a clinical decision support system and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis recommendations, or treatment guidance. The clinical patterns, medication regimens, and lab values produced are for software testing, development, training, and demonstration purposes. They reflect general healthcare conventions but should never be used for actual patient care decisions.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to generate:

- **Clinical Data** - Patients with realistic diagnoses, medications, and lab results
- **Claims Data** - Professional and facility claims with proper adjudication
- **Pharmacy Data** - Prescriptions, pharmacy claims, and drug utilization alerts
- **Saved Scenarios** - Persistent workspaces you can resume, branch, and share

All through simple natural language requests like:
> "Generate a 65-year-old diabetic patient with hypertension and their recent office visit claim"

### County Health Profile

```
Profile Maricopa County, Arizona for health indicators and SDOH
```

This returns real data including:

- Demographics (population, age distribution, race/ethnicity)
- Chronic disease prevalence (diabetes 10.2%, obesity 31.5%, etc.)
- Health behaviors (smoking, binge drinking, physical inactivity)
- Social vulnerability themes (economic, housing, minority status)

### Census Tract Analysis

```
Show health disparities across census tracts in Los Angeles County
```

This provides neighborhood-level granularity:

- Tract-by-tract health measures from CDC PLACES
- SVI vulnerability scores for each tract
- ADI deprivation rankings at block group level

### Cohort Specification

```
Build a cohort specification for a Phase III diabetes trial targeting the Midwest
```

This creates an evidence-based CohortSpecification:

- Target demographics grounded in actual county distributions
- Expected disease prevalence from CDC data
- SDOH factors affecting enrollment feasibility
- Ready to use with PatientSim for realistic patient generation

### Trial Site Selection

```
Identify top 5 counties for a NASH trial based on patient availability and site access
```

This provides trial planning intelligence:

- Disease prevalence rankings from CDC PLACES
- Population size and demographic fit
- Healthcare access indicators from SVI
- Site selection recommendations

### Data-Driven Generation

When you specify a geography, PopulationSim's embedded data grounds generation across all products:

```
Generate 20 diabetic patients for Harris County, TX with real prevalence data
```

This produces patients reflecting actual Harris County statistics:

- 12.1% diabetes prevalence (not generic 10%)
- Real comorbidity correlations (33% obesity, 32% hypertension)
- Demographics matching county distributions
- Data provenance tracking in output

See [examples/populationsim-examples.md](examples/populationsim-examples.md) for detailed examples.

## Hello, Analytics!

HealthSim data can be loaded directly into analytics databases. You have flexibility in how you structure the data - from simple flat tables to full star schemas.

### Local Analytics with DuckDB

Perfect for local development, testing, and demos. No authentication required.

**Simple tables:**

```
Generate 10 diabetic patients and load them into DuckDB
```

**Star schema for BI dashboards:**

```
Generate 10 patients in dimensional format for DuckDB with fact and dimension tables
```

This creates properly normalized analytics tables with:

- Dimension tables (dim_patient, dim_diagnosis, dim_medication, dim_date)
- Fact tables (fact_encounters, fact_lab_results)
- Pre-calculated metrics (age bands, LOS, readmission flags)

### Enterprise Analytics with Databricks

For production analytics, team collaboration, and large-scale testing.

**Prerequisites:** Authenticate via Databricks CLI first:

```bash
databricks auth profiles  # Verify authentication
```

**Load to Databricks:**

```
Generate 10 patients in dimensional format for Databricks, catalog 'dev_catalog', schema 'gold'
```

Claude will:

1. Generate the dimensional data
2. Create tables (if needed)
3. Load via SQL Statements API
4. Report success with row counts

### Claims Analytics

Same flexibility works for claims and pharmacy data:

```
Generate 20 members with claims in star schema format for DuckDB
```

```
Generate pharmacy data with prescription fills as a fact table, load to Databricks
```

See [../formats/dimensional-analytics.md](../formats/dimensional-analytics.md) for complete star schema definitions and sample queries.

## Hello, State Management!

Save your work, pick up where you left off, and explore "what-if" scenarios.

### Save Your Work

After generating data you want to keep:

```text
Save this as my-diabetes-cohort
```

HealthSim saves your entire workspace - all patients, clinical data, claims, and provenance information - to `~/.healthsim/scenarios/`.

### Load Later

Come back tomorrow (or next month) and restore exactly where you left off:

```text
Load my-diabetes-cohort
```

### See What You've Saved

```text
What scenarios do I have?
```

### Why Save Scenarios?

- **Session continuity** - Work on complex cohorts across multiple sessions
- **Reproducibility** - Save test baselines for regression testing
- **Sharing** - Scenarios are portable JSON files you can share with colleagues
- **Version control** - Save before making changes, compare versions

### "What-If" Branching

Build a patient, save a baseline, then explore different paths:

```text
Save this as patient-baseline
```

Now explore an acute complication:

```text
Generate a DKA hospitalization for this patient
Save this as patient-dka-path
```

Or go back and try a different trajectory:

```text
Load patient-baseline
Instead, add gradual progression over 6 months
Save this as patient-progression-path
```

Now you have three scenarios you can compare - perfect for testing how different clinical trajectories affect your systems.
