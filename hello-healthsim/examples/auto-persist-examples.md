# Auto-Persist Examples

_Token-efficient scenario management for large batch operations._

## Overview

The auto-persist pattern enables generating and persisting large batches of synthetic healthcare data without filling the context window. Instead of echoing back all generated data, it returns a compact summary (~500 tokens).

**When to Use Auto-Persist**:
- Generating 50+ entities at once
- Building large cohorts for training or testing
- Batch generation workflows
- Avoiding context overflow in long sessions

**Traditional vs Auto-Persist**:

| Approach | Use Case | Context Impact |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Traditional `save_scenario` | Small scenarios (<50 entities) | Returns all data (~1K-50K tokens) |
| Auto-Persist `persist()` | Large batches (50+ entities) | Returns summary (~500 tokens) |

## Example 1: Generate 100 Medicare Members

### User Prompt
```
Generate 100 Medicare Advantage members over 65 years old in California
```

### Claude Response (using auto-persist)
```
I'll generate 100 Medicare Advantage members for you.

[Generates members using MemberSim skill...]
[Auto-persists to database...]

**Saved "medicare-advantage-20241227"**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Members | 100 |
| Age Range | 65-89 |
| Gender | 48 male, 52 female |
| Geographic | California (Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, etc.) |
| Plan Types | HMO (40), PPO (35), PFFS (25) |

The data is persisted and ready for use. Would you like to:
- Query specific subsets ("show members in San Diego")
- See sample members ("show me 3 example members")
- Generate claims for these members
```

---

## Example 2: Query Saved Scenario Data

### User Prompt
```
From my medicare scenario, show female members over 75 with diabetes
```

### Claude Response
```
[Queries scenario with SQL...]

Found 12 female members over 75 with diabetes:

| Name | Age | City | Plan | Risk Score |
|------|-----|------|------|------------|
| Margaret Wilson | 78 | San Diego | HMO | 1.85 |
| Dorothy Chen | 82 | Los Angeles | PPO | 2.12 |
| Patricia Johnson | 76 | San Francisco | HMO | 1.45 |
| Betty Martinez | 79 | Sacramento | PFFS | 1.92 |
| Ruth Anderson | 81 | Fresno | PPO | 2.34 |
...

Showing 5 of 12 results. Say "show more" to see the rest.

These high-risk members may benefit from care management programs.

[Adding tags...]

Updated scenario:
- **Old name**: medicare-advantage-20241227
- **New name**: ca-medicare-q4-2024

## Technical Details

### Auto-Persist Functions

```python
from healthsim.state import persist, get_summary, query_scenario

# Persist entities - returns summary, not full data
result = persist(
    entities={'patients': [...], 'encounters': [...]},
    context='diabetes cohort for training',
    tags=['diabetes', 'training']
)
# result.summary contains ~500 tokens

# Load summary only
summary = get_summary('scenario-name')
# summary.entity_counts, summary.statistics, summary.samples

# Query with pagination
results = query_scenario(
    'scenario-name',
    "SELECT * FROM patients WHERE gender = 'F'",
    limit=20
)
# results.rows, results.has_more
```

### Token Budget

| Component | Approximate Tokens |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Scenario metadata | ~100 |
| Entity counts | ~50 |
| Statistics summary | ~150 |
| Sample entities (3 per type) | ~200 per type |
| **Total (without samples)** | **~300** |
| **Total (with 3 samples × 5 types)** | **~1,300** |

### Query Security

All queries are validated to ensure they are SELECT-only:
- ✅ `SELECT * FROM patients WHERE...`
- ✅ `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM encounters`
- ❌ `DELETE FROM patients` (blocked)
- ❌ `DROP TABLE scenarios` (blocked)
- ❌ `UPDATE members SET...` (blocked)

---

## Example 8: Tag Management

### User Prompt
```
What tags do I have across my scenarios?
```

### Claude Response
```
[Listing all tags...]

**Your scenario tags**:

| Tag | Usage Count |
|-----|-------------|
| training | 5 scenarios |
| production | 3 scenarios |
| california | 3 scenarios |
| diabetes | 2 scenarios |
| validated | 2 scenarios |
| testing | 1 scenario |

To find scenarios with a specific tag: "show scenarios tagged production"
To add a tag: "tag my-scenario with validated"
```

---

## Example 9: Clone Scenario for A/B Testing

### User Prompt
```
Clone my diabetes-cohort scenario so I can test a different cohort definition
```

### Claude Response
```
[Cloning scenario...]

**Cloned "diabetes-cohort-20241227" → "diabetes-cohort-20241227-copy"**

| Entity Type | Copied |
|-------------|--------|
| Patients | 150 |
| Encounters | 425 |
| Lab Results | 890 |
| Medications | 320 |
| **Total** | **1,785 entities** |

All entities have new unique IDs. The clone is completely independent - 
changes to either scenario won't affect the other.

Would you like to rename the clone to something more descriptive?
```

---

## Example 10: Merge Multiple Cohorts

### User Prompt
```
Merge my diabetes, heart-failure, and copd scenarios into a combined 
training dataset
```

### Claude Response
```
[Merging 3 scenarios...]

| Source | Patients | Encounters | Labs |
|--------|----------|------------|------|
| diabetes-cohort | 150 | 425 | 890 |
| heart-failure-cohort | 120 | 380 | 720 |
| copd-training | 75 | 210 | 450 |
| **Total** | **345** | **1,015** | **2,060** |

- Conflicts resolved: 0 (no duplicate IDs)
- Tags inherited: training, chronic-disease, validated

All source scenarios remain unchanged. Would you like to:
- View samples from the merged set
- Query specific patient subsets
- Export for external analysis
```
