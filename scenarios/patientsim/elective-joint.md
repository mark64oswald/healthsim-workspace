# Elective Joint Replacement Scenario - Complete Surgical Event Timelines

A scenario template for generating patients undergoing elective total joint arthroplasty (hip or knee replacement) **with complete perioperative event sequences** from pre-operative evaluation through surgery, daily post-operative progression (POD 0-3), complications, and discharge planning.

## For Claude

Use this skill when the user requests orthopedic surgery patients, specifically total joint replacement scenarios. This teaches you how to generate **realistic surgical event timelines** for perioperative patients across all phases - pre-operative optimization, day of surgery, post-operative recovery with daily progression, rehabilitation milestones, and potential complications.

**When to apply this skill:**
- User mentions joint replacement, hip/knee replacement, or arthroplasty
- User requests orthopedic surgery or perioperative scenarios with event timelines
- User asks for elective surgery admissions with complete surgical course
- User specifies POD (post-operative day) patients with progression over time
- User mentions orthopedic complications (DVT, infection, delirium) and their development
- User needs surgical workflow testing or post-op protocol validation

**Key capabilities this skill provides:**
- How to generate complete surgical event timelines (pre-op workup → surgery → POD 0 → POD 1 → POD 2 → POD 3 → discharge)
- How to structure day-by-day progression with vital signs, pain scores, lab trends, PT milestones
- How to sequence pain management events (IV opioids → transition to PO → multimodal analgesia)
- How to create complication event sequences (DVT developing on POD 2, workup, treatment)
- How to select appropriate DVT prophylaxis and show timing (enoxaparin daily dosing)
- How to track PT progression events (POD 1: bedside → POD 2: 100 feet → POD 3: stairs)
- When to send patients home vs skilled nursing facility based on functional milestones
- How to create alert-triggering events (sudden hypotension, tachycardia suggesting bleeding/PE)

**Important**: Joint replacement patients are **high risk for DVT** (10-40% without prophylaxis). Always include DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin, rivaroxaban, or aspirin). Post-operative infections are devastating - include pre-op antibiotics and proper wound care.

**Clinical coherence**: Match pain levels to post-op day (POD 0: 6-8/10 → POD 3: 3-5/10), ensure Hgb drop is realistic (typically 2-4 g/dL from blood loss), and include appropriate PT milestones (POD 1: bedside → POD 2: 100 feet → POD 3: stairs). Show **temporal progression** with events occurring in realistic sequence.

### Joint Replacement Overview

Total joint arthroplasty (hip or knee replacement) is one of the most successful elective surgeries, providing dramatic pain relief and functional improvement for end-stage osteoarthritis. Over 1 million joint replacements are performed annually in the US.

**Typical Patient Profile**:
- Age 60-80 years (peak age range)
- BMI 25-35 (obesity is both a risk factor for OA and surgical risk)
- Years of progressive joint pain limiting function
- Failed conservative management (PT, NSAIDs, injections)
- Comorbidities: HTN (65%), diabetes (25%), hyperlipidemia (50%)

**Why this matters for generation**: Joint replacement patients are generally medically complex with multiple comorbidities requiring pre-operative optimization. They're not young/healthy - they're elderly with chronic conditions.

### Hip vs Knee Replacement - Key Differences

**Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)**:
- More common than hip (700k/year vs 400k/year)
- More painful post-operatively (knee has more nerve endings)
- ROM more critical (need 90° flexion for stairs, transfers)
- Rehab more intensive
- Female > Male (55% female)

**Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)**:
- Less painful post-operatively
- Faster recovery, earlier discharge
- Dislocation precautions critical (no flexion >90°, no crossing legs, no internal rotation)
- Gender equal distribution
- Extended DVT prophylaxis (35 days vs 10-14 for knee)

**Why this matters for generation**: When generating TKA patients, expect more pain (6-8/10 POD 0), slower mobility, and more intensive PT. For THA, expect hip precautions education and extended anticoagulation.

### Perioperative Timeline Phases

Joint replacement follows a predictable timeline from decision to surgery through recovery:

**Pre-Operative Phase (4-6 weeks before)**:
- Orthopedic consultation → surgery scheduled
- PCP medical clearance (cardiac risk, diabetes control, infection screening)
- Pre-admission testing (PAT) - labs, EKG, anesthesia evaluation
- Medication adjustments (stop NSAIDs/aspirin 7 days before)
- Education (expectations, home preparation, PT goals)

**Day of Surgery (POD 0)**:
- NPO after midnight → Arrive 2h early → Pre-op area
- Prophylactic antibiotics 30-60 min before incision (cefazolin 2g)
- Spinal anesthesia most common (vs general)
- Surgery 2-3 hours → PACU recovery → Floor by afternoon
- Pain control initiated, PT evaluates bedside
- Hemovac drain monitoring (200-300mL expected)

**Post-Operative Days 1-3**:
- POD 1: Drain removed, catheter out, ambulate with PT, transition to oral pain meds
- POD 2: Increase ambulation distance, stairs practice, case management for discharge planning
- POD 3: Final PT clearance, discharge teaching, home/SNF decision

**Why this matters for generation**: When user says "POD 2 patient", you should generate someone who's already had drain/catheter removed (POD 1), is ambulating 50-100 feet with walker, pain 4-5/10, and case management is planning discharge. Don't generate POD 2 with drain still in or patient bed-bound.

### DVT Prophylaxis (Critical Concept)

Joint replacement is **HIGH RISK for venous thromboembolism (VTE)**. Without prophylaxis, 10-40% develop DVT, 1-2% develop PE.

**Prophylaxis Options**:
1. **LMWH** (Low Molecular Weight Heparin): Enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily x 10-14 days (knee) or 35 days (hip)
   - Most common choice, proven efficacy
   - Requires daily injections (patient/family education needed)

2. **DOACs** (Direct Oral Anticoagulants): Rivaroxaban 10mg PO daily x 12-14 days
   - Oral convenience (better compliance)
   - No monitoring required
   - More expensive

3. **Aspirin**: 325mg PO BID x 6 weeks
   - For low-risk patients only
   - Easier to take, lower bleeding risk
   - Less effective than anticoagulants

4. **Mechanical**: SCDs (sequential compression devices) while in hospital
   - Adjunct to pharmacologic, not replacement

**Why this matters for generation**: NEVER generate a joint replacement patient without DVT prophylaxis. This is a critical safety issue. If generating DVT complication, show patient WAS on prophylaxis (it's not 100% effective). Typical scenario: patient on enoxaparin 40mg daily, develops DVT POD 5-7 at home.

### Multimodal Analgesia (Opioid-Sparing Strategy)

Modern pain management uses **multiple medication classes** to minimize opioid use and side effects.

**The Multimodal Approach**:
```python
pain_control_regimen = {
    "acetaminophen": "1000mg PO Q8H scheduled",  # Baseline, non-opioid
    "NSAID": "celecoxib 200mg PO Q12H",  # Anti-inflammatory (if no contraindication)
    "gabapentinoid": "gabapentin 300mg PO TID",  # Neuropathic component
    "local_anesthetic": "periarticular injection in OR (bupivacaine)",  # Lasts 24-48h
    "opioid_breakthrough": "oxycodone 5-10mg PO Q4H PRN",  # Only for breakthrough pain
}

# POD 0: May use PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) hydromorphone
# POD 1-2: Transition to oral opioids PRN
# Goal: Pain <4/10 at rest, <6/10 with PT
```

**Why this matters for generation**: Don't generate patients on opioids alone (outdated practice). Include the full multimodal regimen. Expect pain to improve over time: POD 0 = 6-8/10, POD 1 = 5-6/10, POD 2 = 4-5/10, POD 3 = 3-4/10.

### Pre-Operative Medical Clearance

Elective surgery requires optimization of medical conditions to minimize perioperative risk.

**Medical Clearance Checklist**:
```python
clearance_requirements = {
    "cardiac_risk": "Revised Cardiac Risk Index → stress test if high risk",
    "diabetes": "HbA1c <8% (ideally <7%), optimize glucose control",
    "hypertension": "BP <160/100, continue meds except ACE-I morning of surgery",
    "anticoagulation": "Bridge warfarin if needed (AFib, mechanical valve)",
    "anemia": "Treat if Hgb <12 (iron, EPO)",
    "infection_screening": "UA negative (UTI must be treated before joint replacement)",
    "smoking": "Cessation counseling (increases infection, delayed healing)",
}

medications_to_stop_before_surgery = {
    "NSAIDs": "STOP 7 days before (bleeding risk)",
    "aspirin": "STOP 7 days before (unless cardiac indication)",
    "ACE_inhibitors": "HOLD morning of surgery (hypotension risk)",
    "metformin": "HOLD morning of surgery (lactic acidosis risk)",
}
```

**Why this matters for generation**: If generating pre-op patient, show they've had medical clearance - labs within 30 days, HbA1c <8% if diabetic, UA negative. If generating complications, you can show inadequate pre-op optimization (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes → increased infection risk).

### Post-Operative Complications

**Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** - Most Common:
- Incidence: 10-40% without prophylaxis, 1-5% with prophylaxis
- Timing: Usually POD 5-14, often after discharge
- Presentation: Calf pain, swelling, warmth, positive Homan's sign
- Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound (positive thrombus in popliteal/femoral vein)
- Treatment: Therapeutic anticoagulation (apixaban 10mg BID x 7d → 5mg BID x 3mo)

**Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI)** - Most Devastating:
- Incidence: 1-2%
- Timing: Early (POD 3-30) or late (months-years)
- Presentation: Increasing pain, fever, wound drainage, erythema
- Diagnosis: Joint aspiration (WBC >10,000, positive culture - S. aureus common)
- Treatment: Irrigation & debridement (I&D), 6 weeks IV antibiotics, may require prosthesis removal

**Post-Operative Delirium** - Common in Elderly:
- Incidence: 10-30% (higher in elderly, cognitive impairment)
- Timing: POD 1-3 (peak POD 2)
- Risk Factors: Age >75, polypharmacy, opioids, sleep deprivation
- Presentation: Waxing/waning confusion, disorientation, agitation
- Management: Non-pharmacologic (reorientation, family), minimize opioids, low-dose haloperidol PRN severe agitation

**Why this matters for generation**: Complications should be realistic. DVT presents POD 5-14 at home (not POD 1 in hospital). PJI presents with systemic signs (fever, elevated WBC/ESR/CRP). Delirium happens POD 2-3 in elderly patients on opioids.

## Generation Guidelines

### How to Apply This Knowledge

**When the user says**: "Generate a knee replacement patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Set demographics**:
   ```python
   age = random(60, 80)  # Peak age
   gender = "Female" if random() < 0.55 else "Male"  # Slight female predominance for knee
   BMI = random(28, 34)  # Obesity common
   ```

2. **Add primary diagnosis**:
   - Primary osteoarthritis of right knee (M17.11) [or left M17.12]
   - Duration: 3-5 years of progressive pain
   - Failed conservative management (PT, NSAIDs, injections)

3. **Add realistic comorbidities** (select 2-4):
   - Hypertension (65% probability) → add if yes
   - Type 2 diabetes (25% probability) → add if yes
   - Hyperlipidemia (50% probability) → add if yes
   - Obesity (60% probability) → BMI >30
   - Chronic pain syndrome (very common)
   - GERD (30% probability)

4. **Structure timeline based on context**:
   - If no POD specified: Default to POD 2 (typical teaching case)
   - If "day of surgery": Generate POD 0 timeline
   - If "ready for discharge": Generate POD 3

5. **Include critical safety elements**:
   ```python
   DVT_prophylaxis = "Enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily x 10 days"  # REQUIRED

   multimodal_analgesia = {
       "acetaminophen": "1000mg Q8H scheduled",
       "celecoxib": "200mg Q12H",
       "gabapentin": "300mg TID",
       "oxycodone": "5-10mg Q4H PRN",
   }

   prophylactic_antibiotics = "Cefazolin 2g IV 30 min before incision"  # REQUIRED
   ```

6. **Set appropriate vitals/labs by POD**:
   ```python
   if POD == 0:
       pain = random(6, 8)
       Hgb = baseline_Hgb - random(1, 2)  # Some blood loss
       drain_output = "200-300 mL"

   elif POD == 1:
       pain = random(5, 6)
       Hgb = baseline_Hgb - random(2, 3)  # Peak drop
       drain_removed = True
       catheter_removed = True
       PT_milestone = "Ambulated 30 feet with walker"

   elif POD == 2:
       pain = random(4, 5)
       Hgb = "stable at " + str(baseline_Hgb - 3)
       PT_milestone = "Ambulated 100 feet, stairs x 4 steps"
       case_management = "Planning discharge for POD 3"

   elif POD == 3:
       pain = random(3, 4)
       PT_milestone = "Independent with walker, stairs cleared"
       discharge = True
   ```

7. **Determine disposition**:
   ```python
   if age < 70 and has_home_support and independent_baseline:
       disposition = "Discharge home with home PT 3x/week"
   elif age >= 75 or limited_home_support or complications:
       disposition = "Discharge to SNF for 2-3 weeks rehab"
   ```

**When the user says**: "Generate a patient with post-op DVT"

**Claude should**:
1. **Start with uncomplicated joint replacement** (follow steps above)
2. **Set timeline to POD 5-10** (DVT timing after discharge)
3. **Show patient WAS on prophylaxis**: "Prescribed enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily, reports compliance"
4. **Generate DVT presentation**:
   ```python
   chief_complaint = "Calf pain and swelling"
   HPI = "POD 7 after left THA, discharged POD 3. Reports 2 days progressive left calf pain,
          swelling, warmth. Different from surgical pain. Mild SOB with walking.
          Concerned about blood clot. Compliant with enoxaparin injections."

   vitals = {
       "HR": random(95, 105),  # Mild tachycardia
       "RR": random(18, 22),  # Mild tachypnea
       "O2": random(92, 95),  # Mild hypoxia possible
       "Temp": 98.6,  # Afebrile
   }

   exam = {
       "surgical_site": "Healing well, no signs of infection",
       "affected_calf": "Swollen, warm, tender to palpation, positive Homan's sign",
   }

   diagnostic = {
       "D-dimer": "3500 ng/mL (elevated, but expected post-op)",
       "Doppler_ultrasound": "Positive for thrombus in popliteal vein",
       "CTA_chest": "No PE (if dyspnea present)",
   }

   treatment = {
       "STOP": "Enoxaparin 40mg (prophylactic)",
       "START": "Apixaban 10mg PO BID x 7 days, then 5mg BID x 3 months",
       "education": "Bleeding precautions, leg elevation, continue ambulation",
   }
   ```

**When the user says**: "Elderly patient with post-op delirium"

**Claude should**:
1. **Set age 75-85 years** (major risk factor)
2. **Add risk factors**:
   - Pre-existing mild cognitive impairment
   - Polypharmacy (5+ home meds)
   - Poor vision/hearing
   - Lives alone (less stimulation)

3. **Set timeline to POD 2** (peak delirium timing)
4. **Generate delirium presentation**:
   ```python
   presentation = {
       "onset": "POD 2 morning, nursing reports patient confused",
       "mental_status": "Waxing/waning confusion, disoriented to place/time, agitated",
       "sleep": "Reversed sleep-wake cycle, up all night",
       "vitals": "Normal (delirium is clinical diagnosis)",
   }

   workup_to_rule_out_other_causes = {
       "UA": "Negative (no UTI)",
       "CXR": "Clear (no pneumonia)",
       "BMP": "Normal (no metabolic derangement)",
       "O2_sat": "97% RA (no hypoxia)",
   }

   contributing_factors = [
       "Moderate pain (7/10) → increased opioid use",
       "Sleep deprivation (vital signs Q4H, unfamiliar environment)",
       "Polypharmacy (opioids, gabapentin, multiple home meds)",
       "Age >75",
   ]

   management = {
       "non_pharmacologic": [
           "Reorientation (clock, calendar, glasses, hearing aids)",
           "Family presence during day",
           "Sleep hygiene (reduce nighttime interruptions)",
           "Early mobilization with PT",
       ],
       "pharmacologic": [
           "REDUCE opioids (switch to acetaminophen/celecoxib)",
           "AVOID benzodiazepines (paradoxical agitation)",
           "Haloperidol 0.5mg PO Q6H PRN severe agitation (last resort)",
       ],
       "disposition": "Extended hospital stay (5-7 days), likely SNF placement",
   }
   ```

### Coherence Checks

**When generating joint replacement patients, ensure**:

1. **Hemoglobin drop is realistic**:
   ```python
   # Expected blood loss in joint replacement: 500-1000mL
   # Hgb typically drops 2-4 g/dL

   if pre_op_Hgb == 13.5:
       POD_1_Hgb = random(9.5, 11.5)  # 2-4 point drop

       if POD_1_Hgb < 8.0:
           transfusion_indicated = True  # Symptomatic or <8

   # DON'T generate: Pre-op Hgb 13 → POD 1 Hgb 12.5 (too little drop)
   # DON'T generate: Pre-op Hgb 13 → POD 1 Hgb 6 (too much, would need transfusion)
   ```

2. **Pain trajectory makes sense**:
   ```python
   # Pain should IMPROVE over time with PT and meds

   pain_by_POD = {
       0: random(6, 8),  # Highest pain, immediate post-op
       1: random(5, 6),  # Improving
       2: random(4, 5),  # Continuing to improve
       3: random(3, 4),  # Ready for discharge
   }

   # DON'T generate: POD 3 with pain 8/10 (should be improving, or suspect complication)
   ```

3. **PT milestones match POD**:
   ```python
   PT_progression = {
       "POD 0": "Bedside evaluation, dangling legs, may sit in chair",
       "POD 1": "Stand at bedside, transfer practice, ambulate 20-30 feet with walker",
       "POD 2": "Ambulate 50-100 feet, stairs practice (4 steps with rail)",
       "POD 3": "Independent with walker, stairs cleared (8-12 steps), ready for discharge",
   }

   # DON'T generate: POD 1 patient walking 200 feet (too fast)
   # DON'T generate: POD 3 patient bed-bound (should be ambulating by now)
   ```

4. **DVT prophylaxis is ALWAYS included**:
   ```python
   # Every joint replacement patient needs DVT prophylaxis

   if scenario == "joint_replacement":
       assert "enoxaparin" in medications or "rivaroxaban" in medications or "aspirin 325mg" in medications

       # If NO prophylaxis listed, this is an error - joint replacement is HIGH RISK
   ```

5. **Disposition matches patient factors**:
   ```python
   def determine_disposition(age, home_support, baseline_function, complications):
       if complications:
           return "SNF for extended rehab"
       elif age >= 75 and home_support == "limited":
           return "SNF for 2-3 weeks"
       elif baseline_function == "independent" and home_support == "good":
           return "Home with home PT 3x/week"
       else:
           return "SNF for short-term rehab"

   # 82-year-old living alone → SNF likely
   # 65-year-old with spouse, independent baseline → Home likely
   ```

- complication_type: delirium
- **Risk Factors**: Age >75, pre-existing cognitive impairment, poor vision/hearing, polypharmacy
- **POD 2 Presentation**: Waxing/waning confusion, disorientation, agitation, sleep-wake disturbance
- **Workup**: Rule out infection (UA, CXR), metabolic (BMP), hypoxia (ABG)
- **Contributing Factors**: Pain, opioids, sleep deprivation, unfamiliar environment
- **Management**:
  - Non-pharmacologic: Reorientation, family presence, sleep hygiene, minimize interruptions
  - Minimize opioids/benzodiazepines
  - Treat underlying causes
  - Low-dose haloperidol 0.5-1mg PO/IV Q6H PRN severe agitation (last resort)
- **Disposition**: Extended hospital stay (5-7 days), likely SNF placement

### Variation: Post-Op Surgical Site Infection
Patient develops early post-operative joint infection.
- complication_type: infection
- **POD 7-10 Presentation**: Increasing pain, fever, wound drainage, erythema
- **At home**: Calls surgeon's office with concerns
- **Return to hospital**: Admitted for workup
- **Labs**: WBC 18, ESR 120, CRP 200
- **Imaging**: X-ray may show soft tissue swelling, effusion
- **Arthrocentesis**: Joint aspiration shows 50,000 WBCs, culture grows S. aureus
- **Management**:
  - Admit for IV antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftriaxone)
  - Orthopedic surgery: Irrigation and debridement (I&D) in OR
  - Possible removal of prosthesis if deep infection
  - 6 weeks IV antibiotics
  - May require 2-stage revision (remove prosthesis, antibiotics, re-implant later)
- **Outcome**: Prolonged recovery, higher morbidity

### Variation: Outpatient Joint Replacement (Same-Day Discharge)
Low-risk patient selected for outpatient arthroplasty program.
- age_range: 55-70 years
- bmi_range: 20-30 (not obese)
- functional_status: independent
- has_complications: false
- **Selection Criteria**: ASA class 1-2, good home support, lives <30 min from hospital

**Claude interprets**:
- Complication type: DVT (specified)
- Timeline: POD 5-10 (DVT typically occurs after discharge)
- Setting: Patient at home, returns to ED
- Initial surgery: Was uncomplicated, patient WAS on DVT prophylaxis (DVT can still occur despite prophylaxis - it's not 100% effective)

**Claude generates**:

**Patient**: 68-year-old male, POD 7 after left total hip arthroplasty, presenting to ED with left calf pain and swelling

**Chief Complaint**: "Left calf pain and swelling for 2 days"

**HPI**: Patient underwent uncomplicated left THA 7 days ago for severe hip osteoarthritis. Discharged POD 3 to home with home PT. Was doing well until 2 days ago (POD 5) when he developed progressive left calf pain - different character from surgical pain. Calf is swollen and warm. Also notes mild shortness of breath with walking. Concerned about blood clot. **Reports compliance with enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily injections** (due to continue x 10 more days).

**PMH**: Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes (well-controlled), obesity, chronic back pain

**Surgical History**: Left THA POD 7 (for primary hip OA)

**Initial Post-Op Course**: Uncomplicated - discharged POD 3 ambulating with walker, pain controlled, incision healing well.

**ED Presentation**:

**Vitals**: BP 142/88, HR 98, Temp 98.6 F, RR 20, O2 94% on room air

**Physical Exam**:
- **General**: Mildly uncomfortable, mildly tachypneic
- **Surgical site**: Left hip incision healing well, no erythema/drainage, no warmth
- **Left hip ROM**: Mild pain with movement (expected post-op), no instability
- **Left calf**: Swollen (3cm larger circumference than right), warm to touch, tender to palpation, positive Homan's sign
- **Lungs**: Clear bilaterally, no wheezing/rales
- **Cardiac**: Regular rate, mildly tachycardic

**Labs**:
- **D-dimer**: 3800 ng/mL (markedly elevated, but non-specific post-op)
- **CBC**: WBC 8.2 K/uL, Hgb 11.5 g/dL (stable from discharge), Plt 285 K/uL
- **BMP**: Within normal limits
- **Troponin**: <0.01 (negative)

**Imaging**:
- **Doppler Ultrasound Left Lower Extremity**: **Positive for non-occlusive thrombus in left popliteal vein and posterior tibial vein**
- **CTA Chest**: **No pulmonary embolism** (ordered due to mild dyspnea/hypoxia - reassuring)

**Diagnosis**: Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of left lower extremity, post-operative (I82.4Y1)

**Risk Factors**: Recent major orthopedic surgery (high risk), age 68, obesity, immobility post-op

**Treatment Plan**:
1. **STOP prophylactic anticoagulation**: Discontinue enoxaparin 40mg daily
2. **START therapeutic anticoagulation**:
   - Apixaban 10mg PO BID x 7 days, then 5mg PO BID
   - Duration: Minimum 3 months (provoked DVT from surgery)
3. **Supportive care**:
   - Leg elevation when sitting/lying
   - Compression stockings (knee-high, 20-30 mmHg)
   - **Continue ambulation** (walking helps, bed rest is harmful)
4. **Education**:
   - Bleeding precautions (avoid falls, monitor for blood in stool/urine)
   - Signs of PE to watch for (chest pain, severe SOB, syncope → call 911)
   - Medication adherence critical

**Disposition**: Discharge home from ED (no PE, hemodynamically stable)

**Follow-Up**:
- PCP in 2 days: Monitor for PE symptoms, assess bleeding risk
- Repeat Doppler ultrasound in 1 week: Assess clot progression/stability
- Continue home PT, advance activities as tolerated
- Orthopedic surgeon follow-up in 1 week (originally scheduled for 2 weeks, moved up)

**Prognosis**: Good - most post-surgical DVTs resolve with anticoagulation, low recurrence risk after completing treatment

**Claude interprets**:
- Age: 75-85 (elderly, major delirium risk factor)
- Joint: Hip replacement (specified)
- Complication: Delirium (specified)
- POD: 2 (peak delirium timing, specified by typical onset)
- Risk factors: Should include age, polypharmacy, cognitive impairment, opioids

**Claude generates**:

**Patient**: 82-year-old male, POD 2 after left total hip arthroplasty, developed acute confusion overnight

**Chief Concern** (Nursing Report): "Patient very confused this morning, doesn't know where he is, agitated, trying to get out of bed"

**Background**:

**Surgery**: Left THA performed 2 days ago for severe hip osteoarthritis

**PMH**:
- Hypertension
- Mild cognitive impairment (baseline MMSE 24/30, lives independently with wife's help)
- Hard of hearing (wears hearing aids, but didn't bring to hospital)
- Cataracts (decreased vision)
- BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia)
- GERD

**Pre-Op Baseline**: Independent with ADLs, walks with cane, drives, manages medications with wife's assistance. Oriented x3, occasionally forgets names/words.

**Post-Op Course**:

**POD 0-1**: Unremarkable - pain controlled with PCA, ambulated 20 feet with PT on POD 1, appropriate/oriented

**POD 2 (Current) - Delirium Onset**:

**Timeline**:
- **0200** (overnight): Nurse found patient trying to climb out of bed, disoriented, said "I need to go to work" (retired 20 years ago)
- **0400**: Agitated, pulling at IV, yelling for wife
- **0600**: Waxing/waning - periods of calm, then agitation
- **0800** (current): Disoriented to place/time, doesn't recognize daughter at bedside

**Current Mental Status**:
- **Alertness**: Awake, hypervigilant
- **Orientation**: Disoriented to place and time (thinks he's at home, thinks it's 1995), oriented to person (knows his name)
- **Attention**: Extremely poor - cannot focus on questions
- **Speech**: Rambling, tangential, perseverating on "need to go to work"
- **Mood**: Anxious, agitated
- **Behavior**: Restless, attempting to get out of bed, pulling at lines/wires
- **Hallucinations**: Reports seeing "bugs on the wall" (visual hallucinations common in delirium)
- **Sleep**: Nurse reports sleep-wake reversal - up most of night, sleeping during day

**Vitals**: BP 152/88 (elevated from baseline 130s), HR 92, Temp 98.8 F, RR 18, O2 96% RA

**Physical Exam**:
- **General**: Elderly male, agitated, not following commands consistently
- **HEENT**: Not wearing hearing aids (can't find them), decreased vision without glasses
- **Neurologic**: Waxing/waning alertness, disoriented, otherwise non-focal
- **Surgical site**: Left hip incision clean/dry/intact, no erythema
- **Lungs**: Clear (no pneumonia)
- **Abdomen**: Soft, non-tender (bowel sounds present)

**Delirium Workup** (Rule Out Underlying Causes):

**Labs**:
- **CBC**: WBC 10.2 K/uL (normal post-op), Hgb 10.5 g/dL (stable)
- **BMP**: Na 138, K 3.8, Cl 102, CO2 24, BUN 22, Cr 1.1 (baseline), Glucose 118
- **Urinalysis**: Negative (no UTI)
- **ABG**: Not indicated (O2 sat normal, no respiratory symptoms)

**Imaging**:
- **CXR**: Clear, no infiltrate/effusion (no pneumonia)

**Conclusion**: **No acute medical cause identified** - delirium is multifactorial

**Contributing Risk Factors**:
1. **Age 82** (major risk factor)
2. **Baseline mild cognitive impairment** (predisposes to delirium)
3. **Sensory impairment**: No hearing aids, no glasses (disoriented without cues)
4. **Opioid use**: Oxycodone 10mg Q4H (total 60mg in last 24h - high for elderly)
5. **Sleep deprivation**: Vitals Q4H, unfamiliar environment, hospital noise
6. **Polypharmacy**: Opioids + gabapentin + home meds (8 total medications)
7. **Pain**: 6/10 (undertreated pain can worsen delirium)
8. **Immobility**: Limited mobility post-op

**Management Plan**:

**Non-Pharmacologic (First-Line)**:
1. **Re-orientation**:
   - Find hearing aids, glasses → improve sensory input
   - Clock, calendar visible at bedside
   - Frequent re-orientation by staff ("Mr. Smith, you're in the hospital, you had hip surgery")
   - Family presence (daughter to stay during day)

2. **Sleep Hygiene**:
   - Reduce nighttime interruptions (cluster vital signs, labs in AM only)
   - Lights off at night, open blinds during day
   - Quiet environment

3. **Early Mobilization**:
   - PT twice daily (walking helps cognitive function)
   - Out of bed to chair for meals

4. **Avoid Physical Restraints** (worsens agitation)
   - 1:1 sitter if needed for safety
   - Move to room closer to nurses' station

**Pharmacologic Adjustments**:
1. **Reduce Opioids** (major contributor):
   - STOP scheduled oxycodone
   - Increase acetaminophen to 1000mg Q6H (around the clock)
   - Add ice, elevation
   - Oxycodone 5mg Q6H PRN only (half previous dose)

2. **Avoid Benzodiazepines** (paradoxical agitation in elderly)

3. **If Severe Agitation** (safety risk):
   - Haloperidol 0.5mg PO/IV Q6H PRN severe agitation (lowest dose, last resort)
   - Monitor QTc on EKG

**Disposition**:
- Extended hospital stay likely (5-7 days vs typical 3)
- Discharge to **skilled nursing facility (SNF)** for rehabilitation (cannot go home with delirium)
- Delirium may take days-weeks to fully resolve

**Family Discussion**:
- Explain delirium is common post-op, usually resolves
- Reassure this is not permanent dementia (though may unmask underlying cognitive decline)
- Importance of non-pharmacologic interventions
- SNF placement temporary - goal is to return home once delirium clears and PT goals met

### Example 5: Disposition-Specific - "Patient being discharged to SNF after joint replacement"

**User says**: "Generate a patient being discharged to SNF after knee replacement"

**Claude interprets**:
- Joint: Knee replacement (specified)
- POD: 3-4 (typical discharge timing)
- Disposition: SNF (specified) - need to identify why (age, limited support, complications, or functional status)
- Status: Medically stable, meets discharge criteria from hospital, but needs extended rehab

**Claude generates**:

**Patient**: 78-year-old female, POD 4 after bilateral total knee arthroplasty, being discharged to skilled nursing facility (SNF) for rehabilitation

**Background**:

**Surgery**: Bilateral TKA performed 4 days ago for severe bilateral knee osteoarthritis

**PMH**: Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes (well-controlled), obesity (BMI 33), osteoporosis, chronic pain

**Social History**:
- **Lives**: Alone in 2-story home (bedrooms upstairs)
- **Functional Baseline**: Independent with ADLs, ambulates with cane, grocery shopping with assistance
- **Support**: Daughter lives 45 minutes away, works full-time (cannot provide daily care)

**Why SNF vs Home**:
1. **Bilateral surgery** (more challenging rehab than unilateral)
2. **Age 78** (slower recovery)
3. **Limited home support** (lives alone, daughter not nearby)
4. **Home not accessible** (stairs to bedroom, bathroom)
5. **Need for intensive PT** (bilateral = more intensive rehab needs)

**Hospital Course**:

**POD 0-1**: Bilateral TKA performed, spinal anesthesia, uncomplicated. Significant pain initially (8/10), managed with PCA. Blood loss greater than unilateral (Hgb dropped from 12.8 to 9.2). Drains removed POD 1, Foley removed POD 1.

**POD 2-3**: Transitioned to oral pain meds. PT challenging due to bilateral pain - ambulated 40 feet with walker and significant assist on POD 2, 75 feet with walker and minimal assist POD 3. Pain 6/10 with movement.

**POD 4 (Discharge Day)**:

**Current Status**:
- **Pain**: 5/10 at rest, 7/10 with PT (still significant due to bilateral surgery)
- **Mobility**: Ambulates 100 feet with walker, requires standby assist for safety, bilateral pain limits endurance
- **Stairs**: Not yet cleared (too painful, would need to do both legs)
- **ADLs**: Needs assist with bathing (cannot reach feet), dressing lower body
- **Vitals**: Stable - BP 138/82, HR 76, Temp 98.4 F, O2 97% RA

**Physical Exam**:
- **Bilateral Knees**: Incisions clean/dry/intact, no erythema/drainage/warmth, ROM limited by pain (flexion 80° bilaterally - needs improvement)
- **General**: Ambulatory with walker, slow gait, guarding both knees

**Labs (POD 3)**:
- **CBC**: WBC 9.8 K/uL, Hgb 9.5 g/dL (stable, no transfusion needed), Plt 298 K/uL
- **BMP**: Within normal limits

**Discharge Planning Meeting** (POD 3):
- **Case Manager**, **Patient**, **Daughter**, **PT**, **Surgeon** present
- **Options Discussed**:
  - Home with 24/7 caregiver (patient declined, too expensive)
  - Home with daughter moving in (daughter cannot take leave from work)
  - **SNF for short-term rehab** (recommended, patient agreed)

**SNF Selection**:
- Patient/daughter chose "Oakwood Rehabilitation Center" (3 miles from daughter's work, good reputation)
- **Anticipated Length of Stay**: 2-3 weeks
- **Goals**: Independent ambulation with walker, stairs clearance, independent ADLs, pain control

**Discharge Medications** (Going to SNF):

**Pain Management**:
- Acetaminophen 1000mg PO Q8H scheduled
- Celecoxib 200mg PO Q12H
- Gabapentin 300mg PO TID
- Oxycodone 10mg PO Q6H PRN pain (higher dose due to bilateral surgery)

**DVT Prophylaxis**:
- Enoxaparin 40mg SQ Q24H x 10 more days (total 14 days)

**Home Medications Resumed**:
- Lisinopril 20mg PO QD
- Metformin 1000mg PO BID
- Atorvastatin 40mg PO QHS
- Alendronate 70mg PO Q weekly (osteoporosis)

**Other**:
- Omeprazole 40mg PO QD
- Docusate 100mg PO BID PRN constipation

**Discharge Instructions**:

**Activity**:
- Weight-bearing as tolerated with walker
- PT at SNF daily
- NO driving until cleared by surgeon (6 weeks)
- Use walker at all times

**Wound Care**:
- Dressings will be changed by SNF nursing
- Keep incisions clean and dry, no soaking
- Watch for signs of infection (increased pain, redness, drainage, fever)

**Medications**:
- All medications will be managed by SNF
- Enoxaparin injections by SNF nursing staff

**Follow-Up Appointments**:
- **Orthopedic Surgeon**: 2 weeks (at surgeon's office - daughter will transport from SNF)
  - Suture/staple removal
  - X-rays to assess hardware position
  - Wound check
- **PCP**: 4 weeks (after discharge from SNF to home)

**SNF Orders**:

**Therapy Orders**:
- **PT**: Daily (5-7 days/week)
  - Gait training, strengthening, ROM exercises
  - Stairs training (critical for home discharge)
  - Goal: Independent with walker, stairs x 12 steps
- **OT**: 3x/week
  - ADL training (bathing, dressing, toileting)
  - Adaptive equipment training

**Nursing Orders**:
- Vital signs daily
- Wound assessment daily
- Enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily (nursing to administer)
- Pain assessment Q4H, goal <5/10

**Labs**: None needed (stable)

**Discharge Criteria from SNF** (Goals for Home):
1. Independent ambulation with walker (no assist needed)
2. Able to navigate stairs safely (minimum 8 steps for home)
3. Independent with ADLs or minimal assist
4. Pain controlled on oral meds (<4/10)
5. Safe home environment prepared (bathroom rails installed, bedroom moved to first floor temporarily)

**SNF Discharge Plan** (Anticipated):
- **Week 2-3**: Re-assess home readiness
- If ready: Discharge home with home PT 2-3x/week x 4 weeks
- If not ready: Extended SNF stay (up to 4 weeks)

**Prognosis**: Good - bilateral TKA has excellent long-term outcomes, but recovery is slower and more challenging than unilateral. With intensive PT at SNF, expect patient to achieve home discharge goals in 2-3 weeks.

## Clinical Reasoning Patterns

### Pre-Operative Optimization

**Medical Clearance Checklist**:
- Cardiac risk assessment (Revised Cardiac Risk Index)
- If high-risk cardiac: Consider stress test, cardiology clearance
- Diabetes: HbA1c <8% (ideally <7%), optimize glucose control
- Hypertension: BP <160/100 (hold ACE-I morning of surgery)
- Anticoagulation: Bridge if on warfarin for AFib (stop 5 days prior, start LMWH)
- Nutrition: Optimize if malnourished (albumin >3.0)
- Anemia: Treat if Hgb <12 (consider iron, EPO)
- Smoking: Cessation counseling (increases infection, delayed healing)

**Medication Management**:
- **STOP 7 days before**: NSAIDs, aspirin (bleeding risk)
- **STOP morning of**: ACE-I/ARB (hypotension risk), metformin (lactic acidosis risk)
- **CONTINUE**: Beta-blockers, statins, antihypertensives (except ACE-I)
- **BRIDGE if needed**: Warfarin (for mechanical valves, high-risk AFib)

### DVT Prophylaxis Strategy

**Risk Assessment**:
- Joint replacement = **HIGH RISK** for VTE (10-40% without prophylaxis)
- Additional risk factors: Age >60, obesity, prolonged immobility, cancer, prior VTE

**Prophylaxis Options** (AAOS guidelines):
1. **Pharmacologic**:
   - LMWH (enoxaparin 40mg SQ daily) x 10-14 days - most common
   - DOACs (rivaroxaban 10mg daily, apixaban 2.5mg BID) x 12-14 days - oral convenience
   - Warfarin (INR 2-3) - less common, requires monitoring
   - Aspirin 325mg BID x 6 weeks - option for low-risk patients

2. **Mechanical**:
   - Sequential compression devices (SCDs) - use in hospital
   - TED stockings - limited evidence

3. **Early Mobilization** - MOST IMPORTANT

**Duration**: Minimum 10-14 days, extended to 35 days for hip replacement

### Post-Operative Pain Management

**Multimodal Analgesia** (opioid-sparing):
1. **Acetaminophen** 1000mg Q8H scheduled (baseline)
2. **NSAIDs** Celecoxib 200mg Q12H (if no contraindication)
3. **Gabapentinoids** Gabapentin 300mg TID (neuropathic component)
4. **Local Anesthesia** Periarticular injection in OR (bupivacaine, ropivacaine)
5. **Opioids** Short-acting PRN for breakthrough (oxycodone, hydromorphone)

**Avoid**:
- Long-acting opioids (unnecessary for acute pain)
- Excessive opioids (delirium, constipation, falls, respiratory depression)

**Goal**: Pain <4/10 at rest, <6/10 with PT

### Infection Prevention

**Strategies**:
- Pre-op antibiotics 30-60 min before incision (cefazolin 2g)
- Re-dose if surgery >4 hours
- Nasal decontamination if MRSA carrier (mupirocin)
- Chlorhexidine shower night before and morning of surgery
- Strict sterile technique in OR
- Minimize OR traffic
- Tight glucose control perioperatively (<180 mg/dL)
- Normothermia (warming blankets)
- Wound closed in layers, waterproof dressing

**If Infection Suspected**:
- High clinical suspicion: Pain out of proportion, fever, wound drainage
- Labs: WBC, ESR (>100 suspicious), CRP (>100 suspicious)
- Arthrocentesis: Synovial fluid cell count, culture
- Criteria for PJI: WBC >10,000 in joint fluid, positive culture

### Discharge Planning

**Discharge Criteria**:
- Pain controlled on oral medications (<5/10)
- Ambulating safely with assistive device
- Adequate ROM for function (90° knee flexion for transfers)
- Voiding without catheter
- Tolerating PO intake
- Incision stable
- Vitals stable
- Safe discharge plan

**Disposition Options**:
1. **Home** - preferred if able
   - Requires: Safe home environment, support person, able to perform ADLs
   - Arrange: Home PT 3x/week, DME (walker, toilet riser)
2. **Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)** - short-term rehab
   - Indications: Limited home support, need for intensive PT, medical complexity
   - Duration: 2-3 weeks typically
3. **Acute Rehab** - rare
   - For patients with major complications, prolonged recovery needs

**Post-Discharge Monitoring**:
- Wound check at 2 weeks (suture/staple removal)
- X-ray at 6 weeks (assess component position, early healing)
- Final assessment 3-6 months (ROM, return to activities)
