# Colorectal Cancer Management

Comprehensive scenario skill for generating realistic colorectal cancer patient journeys, covering colon and rectal cancer from screening detection through surgery, adjuvant therapy, metastatic treatment, and surveillance.

## For Claude

Use this skill when generating colorectal cancer patients across the care continuum. This teaches you how to generate **realistic clinical event sequences** for colorectal cancer patients - from screening colonoscopy through diagnosis, staging, treatment, and long-term surveillance.

**When to apply this skill:**
- User mentions colon cancer, rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer
- User requests GI oncology or colorectal treatment scenarios
- User specifies FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, or other colorectal regimens
- User asks about MSI/dMMR status or Lynch syndrome
- User mentions KRAS, NRAS, or BRAF testing in colorectal context
- User asks about anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab, panitumumab)
- User needs liver metastases scenarios (common in CRC)
- User requests colonoscopy screening or polyp surveillance

**Key capabilities this skill provides:**
- How to generate complete treatment timelines based on site (colon vs rectum) and stage
- How to distinguish colon cancer management (surgery first) from rectal cancer (often neoadjuvant first)
- How to apply biomarker status to treatment selection (RAS, BRAF, MSI)
- How to model liver-limited metastatic disease with curative intent
- How to incorporate sidedness (left vs right) into treatment decisions
- How to generate hereditary syndrome patterns (Lynch, FAP)
- How to structure screening and surveillance colonoscopy schedules

**Important**: Site matters in colorectal cancer. Colon cancer typically gets surgery first, then adjuvant chemotherapy. Locally advanced rectal cancer often needs neoadjuvant chemoradiation before surgery. ALWAYS confirm RAS mutation status before considering anti-EGFR therapy - mutated RAS excludes these agents.

## Purpose

This scenario generates realistic colorectal cancer patients across the disease spectrum, from screen-detected polyps and early-stage cancers through metastatic disease. It simulates the multi-disciplinary approach to colorectal cancer care including surgery, radiation (primarily rectal), chemotherapy, and targeted/immunotherapy.

The scenario is designed to:
- Model realistic colorectal cancer presentations (screening vs symptomatic)
- Distinguish colon from rectal cancer management approaches
- Generate appropriate staging workups and biomarker testing
- Simulate treatment planning based on stage, site, and molecular profile
- Support potentially curative metastatic disease (liver-limited)
- Include hereditary syndromes (Lynch, FAP)
- Cover screening and surveillance patterns

## Domain Knowledge

### Anatomic Site Classification

The location of colorectal cancer determines both surgical approach and treatment sequencing.

**Why this matters for generation**: Colon cancer and rectal cancer have fundamentally different management approaches. Colon cancer typically undergoes surgery first. Locally advanced rectal cancer often requires neoadjuvant treatment before surgery.

**Colon Cancer (70% of CRC)**:
```
Right-sided (proximal):
  - Cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, proximal transverse
  - ~40% of colon cancers
  - More often MSI-high
  - More often BRAF-mutated
  - Poorer prognosis stage-for-stage
  - Less benefit from anti-EGFR therapy even if RAS wild-type
  - Surgical approach: Right hemicolectomy

Left-sided (distal):
  - Distal transverse, splenic flexure, descending, sigmoid
  - ~60% of colon cancers
  - Usually microsatellite stable (MSS)
  - Better prognosis stage-for-stage
  - Better response to anti-EGFR therapy if RAS wild-type
  - Surgical approach: Left hemicolectomy or sigmoidectomy
```

**Rectal Cancer (30% of CRC)**:
```
Location:
  - Within 15 cm of anal verge
  - Upper rectum (10-15 cm): May be treated like colon
  - Mid rectum (5-10 cm): Neoadjuvant therapy common
  - Low rectum (<5 cm): Sphincter preservation considerations

Key differences from colon:
  - Higher local recurrence risk
  - Neoadjuvant chemoRT for locally advanced (T3-4 or N+)
  - TME (total mesorectal excision) surgery
  - May achieve complete clinical response (watch-and-wait option)
  - Pelvic radiation considerations
```

### Staging System

AJCC 8th Edition TNM staging for colorectal cancer.

**T Staging (Depth of Invasion)**:
| Stage | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Tis | In situ, intramucosal | Carcinoma in situ |
| T1 | Invades submucosa | May be polypectomy candidate |
| T2 | Invades muscularis propria | Requires segmental resection |
| T3 | Invades pericolorectal tissues | Most common T stage at diagnosis |
| T4a | Penetrates visceral peritoneum | Serosal involvement |
| T4b | Invades adjacent organs/structures | Direct extension |

**N Staging (Lymph Node Involvement)**:
| Stage | Description | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| N0 | No regional node metastasis | Minimum 12 nodes examined |
| N1a | 1 positive node | Stage III |
| N1b | 2-3 positive nodes | Stage III |
| N1c | Tumor deposits without nodes | Satellite nodules |
| N2a | 4-6 positive nodes | Higher risk |
| N2b | 7+ positive nodes | Highest node burden |

**M Staging (Distant Metastases)**:
| Stage | Description | Clinical Implications |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| M0 | No distant metastasis | Potentially curable |
| M1a | Single organ, no peritoneal | Liver-only may be resectable |
| M1b | Two+ organs, no peritoneal | Usually palliative |
| M1c | Peritoneal metastasis | Poorest prognosis |

**Stage Grouping**:
```
Stage 0:    Tis N0 M0           (carcinoma in situ)
Stage I:    T1-2 N0 M0          (localized, excellent prognosis)
Stage IIA:  T3 N0 M0            (through wall, no nodes)
Stage IIB:  T4a N0 M0           (serosal penetration)
Stage IIC:  T4b N0 M0           (adjacent organ invasion)
Stage IIIA: T1-2 N1 M0, T1 N2a  (node positive, limited T)
Stage IIIB: T3-4a N1 M0, T2-3 N2a, T1-2 N2b (node positive, moderate T)
Stage IIIC: T4a N2a M0, T3-4a N2b, T4b N1-2 (node positive, advanced T)
Stage IVA:  Any T, Any N, M1a   (single site metastasis)
Stage IVB:  Any T, Any N, M1b   (multiple site metastasis)
Stage IVC:  Any T, Any N, M1c   (peritoneal metastasis)
```

### Biomarker Profiles

Biomarker status is critical for treatment selection in colorectal cancer.

**MSI/MMR Status (Testing Required in All CRC)**:
```
MSI-High (dMMR) - 15% of CRC:
  Clinical significance:
    - Better prognosis in early stage
    - Does NOT benefit from 5-FU adjuvant alone in Stage II
    - Excellent response to immunotherapy in metastatic
    - Associated with Lynch syndrome (germline) or sporadic (MLH1 methylation)

  Testing methods:
    - IHC for MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2)
    - PCR for microsatellite markers
    - NGS panels

  Treatment implications:
    - Stage II MSI-H: Usually NO adjuvant chemotherapy
    - Stage IV MSI-H: Pembrolizumab first-line option

MSS (pMMR) - 85% of CRC:
  - Standard chemotherapy regimens
  - Limited benefit from single-agent immunotherapy
  - Anti-EGFR eligible if RAS wild-type
```

**RAS Mutations (KRAS/NRAS)**:
```
RAS Mutated - 50-55% of CRC:
  Mutations tested:
    - KRAS exon 2 (codons 12, 13) - most common
    - KRAS exon 3 (codon 61)
    - KRAS exon 4 (codons 117, 146)
    - NRAS exon 2, 3, 4

  Clinical significance:
    - CONTRAINDICATION to anti-EGFR therapy
    - No cetuximab or panitumumab
    - Use bevacizumab-based regimens instead

RAS Wild-Type - 45-50% of CRC:
  - Eligible for anti-EGFR therapy
  - Left-sided tumors: Anti-EGFR preferred
  - Right-sided tumors: Less benefit from anti-EGFR, consider bevacizumab
```

**BRAF V600E Mutation**:
```
BRAF V600E Mutated - 8-12% of CRC:
  Clinical significance:
    - Poor prognosis
    - Often right-sided, MSI-H, older females
    - Aggressive disease
    - Rapid progression on chemotherapy

  Treatment implications:
    - More intensive chemotherapy (FOLFOXIRI)
    - BRAF-targeted therapy in later lines (encorafenib + cetuximab)
    - If also MSI-H: Immunotherapy
```

**HER2 Amplification**:
```
HER2 Amplified - 2-3% of CRC:
  - Almost exclusively in RAS/BRAF wild-type
  - Anti-HER2 therapy option (trastuzumab + pertuzumab or lapatinib)
  - Testing indicated in RAS wild-type metastatic disease
```

### Biomarker-Treatment Coherence

Treatment must align with biomarker status.

**Coherence Rules**:
```python
# RAS mutation status
if ras_mutated:
    anti_egfr_eligible = False  # Absolutely contraindicated
    preferred_biologic = "bevacizumab"
else:  # RAS wild-type
    if left_sided:
        preferred_biologic = "cetuximab or panitumumab"
    else:  # Right-sided
        preferred_biologic = "bevacizumab"  # Less anti-EGFR benefit

# MSI/MMR status
if msi_high:
    if stage == "II":
        adjuvant_chemo_benefit = "minimal to none"
    if stage == "IV":
        immunotherapy_eligible = True
        pembrolizumab_first_line = True

# BRAF V600E
if braf_v600e_mutated:
    prognosis = "poor"
    consider_folfoxiri = True
    later_line_braf_targeted = True  # encorafenib + cetuximab
```

## Treatment by Stage

### Stage I (T1-2 N0 M0)

Localized disease with excellent prognosis.

**T1 Cancers (submucosal invasion)**:
```
If favorable features (all criteria met):
  - Well/moderately differentiated
  - No lymphovascular invasion
  - Clear margins (>1mm)
  - No tumor budding
  → Polypectomy/local excision may be adequate

If unfavorable features:
  → Segmental resection recommended
```

**T2 Cancers**:
```
Standard treatment:
  - Segmental resection with lymphadenectomy
  - Minimum 12 lymph nodes examined
  - No adjuvant chemotherapy needed
  - 5-year survival: >90%
```

### Stage II (T3-4 N0 M0)

Through bowel wall without lymph node involvement.

**Risk Stratification**:
```
Low-risk Stage II:
  - T3, no adverse features
  - MSI-H (actually favorable)
  → Observation (no adjuvant chemotherapy)

High-risk Stage II (any of):
  - T4 tumor
  - Fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined
  - Poorly differentiated histology
  - Lymphovascular invasion
  - Perineural invasion
  - Tumor perforation or obstruction
  - Close/indeterminate margins
  → Consider adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX or CAPOX, 3-6 months)

MSI-H Stage II:
  - Good prognosis
  - Does NOT benefit from 5-FU alone
  - If other high-risk features, consider observation vs short-course oxaliplatin
```

### Stage III (Any T, N1-2, M0)

Node-positive disease requiring adjuvant chemotherapy.

**Standard Treatment (Colon)**:
```
Surgery first:
  - Segmental resection
  - Lymphadenectomy (minimum 12 nodes)

Adjuvant chemotherapy:
  - Start within 8 weeks of surgery
  - FOLFOX or CAPOX
  - Duration based on risk:
    Low-risk (T1-3, N1): 3 months CAPOX or 3-6 months FOLFOX
    High-risk (T4 or N2): 6 months FOLFOX or CAPOX
```

**Rectal Cancer Stage II-III**:
```
Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) - Preferred:
  - FOLFOX x 4 cycles (induction)
  - Followed by chemoradiation (5-FU or capecitabine + RT)
  - TME surgery
  - Complete response: Consider watch-and-wait

Traditional approach:
  - Neoadjuvant chemoRT (long-course: 5-FU/cape + 50.4 Gy)
  - TME surgery
  - Adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX x 4 months)

Short-course RT option:
  - 25 Gy in 5 fractions
  - Followed by chemotherapy
  - Surgery
```

### Stage IV (Metastatic)

Systemic disease with varying treatment goals.

**Liver-Limited Metastatic Disease (Potentially Curable)**:
```
Resectable at diagnosis:
  - Hepatic resection (staged or simultaneous with primary)
  - Perioperative chemotherapy (FOLFOX or CAPOX)
  - 5-year survival: 25-40%

Initially unresectable, potentially convertible:
  - Conversion chemotherapy (intensive regimen)
  - FOLFOX/FOLFIRI + bevacizumab or anti-EGFR (if RAS WT)
  - Reassess resectability every 2 months
  - Goal: Downstage to resection
```

**Unresectable/Palliative Metastatic Disease**:
```
First-line options:

MSI-High (15%):
  - Pembrolizumab monotherapy (preferred)
  - OR chemotherapy doublet + biologic

MSS/RAS Mutated:
  - FOLFOX or FOLFIRI + bevacizumab
  - Consider FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab if BRAF mutated

MSS/RAS Wild-Type/Left-Sided:
  - FOLFOX or FOLFIRI + cetuximab or panitumumab
  - Anti-EGFR preferred for left-sided

MSS/RAS Wild-Type/Right-Sided:
  - FOLFOX or FOLFIRI + bevacizumab (preferred)
  - Less benefit from anti-EGFR

Second-line and beyond:
  - Switch chemotherapy backbone (FOLFOX ↔ FOLFIRI)
  - May continue bevacizumab beyond progression
  - Regorafenib or TAS-102 for refractory
  - Fruquintinib for refractory
```

Modern use: Often followed by chemotherapy, then surgery
```

## Screening and Surveillance

### Screening (Average Risk)

```
Age to start: 45 years
Preferred method: Colonoscopy every 10 years

Alternatives:
  - FIT (fecal immunochemical test) annually
  - FIT-DNA (Cologuard) every 3 years
  - CT colonography every 5 years
  - Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years (with FIT every 2 years)

Stop screening: Age 75-85 based on health status
```

### High-Risk Screening

**Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC)**:
```
Start: Age 20-25 or 2-5 years before youngest CRC in family
Frequency: Colonoscopy every 1-2 years
Also screen: Endometrial, ovarian, urinary tract, gastric, small bowel
```

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**:
```
Start: Age 10-12
Frequency: Annual sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy
Intervention: Prophylactic colectomy when polyps develop
Also screen: Upper GI for duodenal adenomas
```

**Personal History of CRC**:
```
Post-resection surveillance (see below)
```

**Inflammatory Bowel Disease**:
```
Start: 8 years after diagnosis (pancolitis) or 15 years (left-sided)
Frequency: Every 1-2 years with chromoendoscopy
```

### Post-Treatment Surveillance

**After Curative-Intent Treatment (Stages I-III)**:
```
History and Physical:
  - Every 3-6 months for 2 years
  - Then every 6 months for 3 years
  - Then annually

CEA:
  - If elevated preoperatively, check postop baseline
  - Every 3-6 months for 2 years (Stage II-III)
  - Then every 6 months years 3-5

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
  - Every 6-12 months for 5 years (Stage II-III)
  - Stage I: Less intensive, based on risk factors

Colonoscopy:
  - 1 year post-resection (or within 6 months if not done preop)
  - If normal, repeat at 3 years
  - If still normal, every 5 years

PET-CT: Not routine surveillance (use for suspected recurrence)
```
