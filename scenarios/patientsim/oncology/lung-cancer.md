# Lung Cancer Management

Comprehensive scenario skill for generating realistic lung cancer patient journeys, covering both Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), from diagnosis through biomarker-driven treatment selection, progression, and palliative care.

## For Claude

Use this skill when generating lung cancer patients across the care continuum. This teaches you how to generate **realistic clinical event sequences** for lung cancer patients - from incidental nodule detection or symptomatic presentation through staging, molecular testing, treatment selection, and disease monitoring.

**When to apply this skill:**
- User mentions lung cancer, lung mass, pulmonary nodule
- User requests thoracic oncology or lung cancer treatment scenarios
- User specifies NSCLC, SCLC, adenocarcinoma, or squamous cell lung cancer
- User asks about EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, or PD-L1 testing
- User mentions targeted therapy agents (osimertinib, alectinib, sotorasib)
- User mentions immunotherapy in lung cancer (pembrolizumab, durvalumab)
- User needs brain metastases scenarios (common in lung cancer)
- User requests smoking-related cancer scenarios

**Key capabilities this skill provides:**
- How to generate complete treatment timelines based on histology and biomarkers
- How to match molecular profile with appropriate targeted therapy
- How to distinguish NSCLC treatment from SCLC treatment
- How to create realistic biomarker testing workflows (NGS, PD-L1)
- How to model brain metastases presentation and management
- How to sequence therapies upon progression
- How to structure surveillance for each stage and treatment

**Important**: Lung cancer treatment is highly dependent on histology (NSCLC vs SCLC) and molecular markers. NEVER give targeted therapy without confirming the mutation. ALWAYS test for actionable mutations in non-squamous NSCLC before starting treatment.

## Purpose

This scenario generates realistic lung cancer patients across the disease spectrum, from screen-detected early-stage cancers through metastatic disease. It simulates the biomarker-driven approach to lung cancer care, which has transformed outcomes for patients with actionable mutations.

The scenario is designed to:
- Model realistic lung cancer presentations (incidental finding vs symptomatic)
- Generate appropriate staging workups including PET-CT and brain MRI
- Simulate molecular testing workflows and result interpretation
- Support treatment selection based on histology and biomarkers
- Include brain metastases (common in lung cancer)
- Cover SCLC-specific staging and treatment
- Address treatment toxicities including pneumonitis

## Domain Knowledge

### Histologic Classification

Lung cancer is divided into two major categories with fundamentally different biology and treatment.

**Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - 85%**:
```
Adenocarcinoma (40%):
  - Most common type overall
  - More common in never-smokers
  - Higher rate of actionable mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1)
  - Peripheral location common
  - Test ALL adenocarcinomas for molecular markers

Squamous Cell Carcinoma (25-30%):
  - Strongly associated with smoking
  - Central location (near major bronchi)
  - Lower rate of actionable mutations
  - PD-L1 often high
  - Pemetrexed contraindicated (use taxane instead)

Large Cell Carcinoma (10-15%):
  - Poorly differentiated
  - Can occur anywhere in lung
  - Treat similar to adenocarcinoma
```

**Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) - 15%**:
```
Characteristics:
  - Aggressive, rapidly growing
  - Almost exclusively in smokers
  - Often metastatic at diagnosis
  - High initial response to chemo/radiation
  - High rate of relapse
  - Brain metastases very common

Staging:
  - Limited Stage: Confined to one hemithorax + regional nodes
    - Can be encompassed in tolerable radiation field
    - ~30% of SCLC at diagnosis
  - Extensive Stage: Beyond limited stage
    - Distant metastases or too extensive for radiation
    - ~70% of SCLC at diagnosis
```

**Why this matters for generation**: NSCLC and SCLC are treated completely differently. SCLC does NOT use targeted therapies. Never give osimertinib to SCLC. Always verify histology before selecting treatment.

### Actionable Biomarkers (NSCLC)

**Testing Requirements**:
```python
if histology in ["adenocarcinoma", "nsclc_nos", "large_cell"]:
    must_test = ["EGFR", "ALK", "ROS1", "BRAF", "KRAS", "MET", "RET", "NTRK", "PD-L1"]
    # Broad NGS panel preferred

if histology == "squamous":
    test_if_never_smoker = ["EGFR", "ALK", "ROS1"]  # Lower yield but still test
    always_test = ["PD-L1"]
```

**EGFR Mutations (10-15% of NSCLC, 40-50% in Asians)**:
```
Common Sensitizing Mutations:
  - Exon 19 deletion (45%): Best prognosis
  - L858R (exon 21) (40%): Good response to TKIs

Resistance Mutations:
  - T790M: Develops during 1st/2nd gen TKI therapy
  - C797S: Develops during osimertinib therapy

Exon 20 Insertions:
  - ~10% of EGFR mutations
  - Resistant to standard EGFR TKIs
  - Amivantamab or mobocertinib

Treatment Sequence:
  1st line: Osimertinib (3rd gen TKI, CNS penetrant)
  Progression: Rebiopsy for resistance mechanism
  2nd line: Based on resistance (platinum-chemo if C797S)
```

**ALK Rearrangements (3-5% of NSCLC)**:
```
Patient Profile:
  - Younger patients (median 50s)
  - Light or never smokers
  - Adenocarcinoma histology

Treatment Sequence:
  1st line: Alectinib (preferred) or lorlatinib
  2nd line: Lorlatinib (especially if CNS progression)
  Later lines: Chemotherapy

Key Points:
  - Long survival possible (median 5+ years)
  - High rate of brain mets (use CNS-penetrant TKI)
  - Sequential ALK TKIs can control disease for years
```

**ROS1 Rearrangements (1-2%)**:
```
Treatment:
  1st line: Crizotinib or entrectinib (CNS penetrant)
  2nd line: Lorlatinib

Similar to ALK in many ways:
  - Younger, never smokers
  - Adenocarcinoma
  - Favorable prognosis
```

**BRAF V600E (2-3%)**:
```
Treatment:
  Dabrafenib + trametinib (BRAF + MEK inhibitor combination)

Key Points:
  - Can occur in smokers or never smokers
  - Good responses to targeted therapy
```

**KRAS G12C (13% of NSCLC)**:
```
Treatment:
  - Sotorasib 960mg daily
  - Adagrasib 600mg BID

Key Points:
  - Most common driver mutation
  - Historically "undruggable"
  - Typically used after immunotherapy/chemo
  - Associated with smoking history
```

**MET Exon 14 Skipping (3-4%)**:
```
Treatment:
  Capmatinib or tepotinib

Key Points:
  - Often in older patients
  - Associated with smoking
  - Can occur with high PD-L1
```

**RET Fusions (1-2%)**:
```
Treatment:
  Selpercatinib or pralsetinib

Key Points:
  - Often in younger, never smokers
  - Highly active targeted agents
```

**NTRK Fusions (<1%)**:
```
Treatment:
  Larotrectinib or entrectinib

Key Points:
  - Rare but highly actionable
  - Tumor-agnostic indication
```

**PD-L1 Expression**:
```
Testing: IHC using 22C3 (pembrolizumab) or SP263 (other agents)
Reporting: Tumor Proportion Score (TPS)
  - <1%: Low/negative
  - 1-49%: Low positive
  - ≥50%: High positive

Treatment Implications:
  - TPS ≥50%: Pembrolizumab monotherapy option (no chemo)
  - TPS 1-49%: Pembrolizumab + chemotherapy
  - TPS <1%: Chemotherapy ± ipilimumab + nivolumab
```

### Staging and Workup

**Initial Workup**:
```
1. Imaging:
   - CT chest with contrast (or CT C/A/P)
   - PET-CT (staging, nodal involvement)
   - Brain MRI (required for Stage III-IV, recommended for all)

2. Tissue diagnosis:
   - CT-guided biopsy (peripheral lesions)
   - Bronchoscopy with biopsy (central lesions)
   - EBUS (mediastinal lymph nodes)
   - Thoracentesis (if pleural effusion)

3. Molecular testing (NSCLC):
   - NGS panel (comprehensive, preferred)
   - OR individual tests: EGFR, ALK (FISH/IHC), ROS1, BRAF, KRAS
   - PD-L1 IHC
   - Turnaround time: 1-2 weeks

4. Pulmonary function:
   - PFTs if surgery considered
   - FEV1 and DLCO predict surgical risk

5. Mediastinal staging (if surgery planned):
   - EBUS-TBNA (endobronchial ultrasound)
   - Mediastinoscopy if EBUS inconclusive
```

**NSCLC TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition)**:

| Stage | TNM | Description | 5-Year Survival |
|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| IA1 | T1a N0 M0 | ≤1 cm, no nodes | 92% |
| IA2 | T1b N0 M0 | >1-2 cm, no nodes | 83% |
| IA3 | T1c N0 M0 | >2-3 cm, no nodes | 77% |
| IB | T2a N0 M0 | >3-4 cm, no nodes | 68% |
| IIA | T2b N0 M0 | >4-5 cm, no nodes | 60% |
| IIB | T1-2 N1 M0 | Any T1-2 with hilar nodes | 53% |
| IIB | T3 N0 M0 | >5-7 cm or local invasion | 53% |
| IIIA | Various | Locally advanced, resectable | 36% |
| IIIB | Various | Locally advanced, often unresectable | 26% |
| IIIC | T3-4 N3 M0 | Contralateral/scalene nodes | 13% |
| IVA | Any T, N, M1a-b | Contralateral lung, pleural, single distant met | 10% |
| IVB | Any T, N, M1c | Multiple distant mets | <1% (w/o driver) |

**SCLC Staging**:
```
Limited Stage:
  - Disease confined to one hemithorax
  - May include ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes
  - Can be encompassed in one radiation field
  - ~30% at diagnosis

Extensive Stage:
  - Anything beyond limited stage
  - Contralateral lung involvement
  - Distant metastases
  - Malignant pleural effusion
  - ~70% at diagnosis
```

### Treatment Pathways by Stage (NSCLC)

**Stage I-II (Resectable)**:
```
Standard Approach:
  1. Surgical resection (lobectomy preferred, VATS if possible)
  2. Mediastinal lymph node sampling/dissection
  3. Adjuvant therapy based on stage:
     - Stage IA: Observation only
     - Stage IB: Consider adjuvant chemo if high risk
     - Stage II: Adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin-based × 4 cycles)
     - EGFR+: Adjuvant osimertinib × 3 years

Non-surgical candidates:
  - SBRT (stereotactic body radiation) for Stage I
  - Excellent local control (>90%)
  - Option for medically inoperable patients
```

**Stage III (Locally Advanced)**:
```
Stage IIIA (Potentially Resectable):
  Option 1: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation → Surgery
  Option 2: Definitive chemoradiation → Durvalumab
  - Decision based on tumor board, patient factors

Stage IIIB-IIIC (Unresectable):
  1. Concurrent chemoradiation (6-7 weeks)
     - Cisplatin + etoposide OR carboplatin + paclitaxel
     - 60-66 Gy radiation
  2. Durvalumab consolidation × 1 year
     - If PD-L1 ≥1% (per FDA label) OR any PD-L1 (per NCCN)
     - Start within 1-42 days after chemoradiation
     - Monitor for pneumonitis

Key Toxicities:
  - Esophagitis (during radiation)
  - Pneumonitis (radiation and/or durvalumab)
  - Myelosuppression
```

**Stage IV (Metastatic) - Without Driver Mutation**:
```
PD-L1 ≥50% (no contraindication to immunotherapy):
  Option 1: Pembrolizumab monotherapy
  Option 2: Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + pemetrexed (non-squamous)
  Option 2: Pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel (squamous)

PD-L1 1-49%:
  Pembrolizumab + platinum-doublet chemotherapy × 4 cycles
  Then pembrolizumab maintenance

PD-L1 <1%:
  Option 1: Platinum-doublet + pembrolizumab
  Option 2: Nivolumab + ipilimumab + chemo (CheckMate 9LA)

Non-squamous specific:
  - Pemetrexed-based (carboplatin + pemetrexed + pembrolizumab)
  - Pemetrexed maintenance

Squamous specific:
  - Taxane-based (carboplatin + paclitaxel + pembrolizumab)
  - NO pemetrexed (poor efficacy in squamous)
```

**Stage IV - With Driver Mutation**:
```
EGFR mutated:
  1st line: Osimertinib 80mg daily
  Progression: Rebiopsy → based on resistance mechanism

ALK rearranged:
  1st line: Alectinib 600mg BID or Lorlatinib 100mg daily
  Progression: Next-generation ALK TKI or chemotherapy

ROS1 rearranged:
  1st line: Entrectinib 600mg daily or crizotinib 250mg BID

BRAF V600E:
  1st line: Dabrafenib 150mg BID + trametinib 2mg daily

KRAS G12C:
  After progression on immunotherapy/chemo:
  Sotorasib 960mg daily or adagrasib 600mg BID

MET exon 14:
  1st line: Capmatinib 400mg BID or tepotinib 450mg daily

RET fusion:
  1st line: Selpercatinib 120mg BID or pralsetinib 400mg daily

NTRK fusion:
  1st line: Larotrectinib 100mg BID or entrectinib 600mg daily
```

### Treatment Pathways (SCLC)

**Limited Stage SCLC**:
```
Treatment Intent: Potentially curative

Standard Treatment:
  1. Concurrent chemoradiation
     - Cisplatin 60mg/m² D1 + Etoposide 120mg/m² D1-3 q3w × 4 cycles
     - OR Carboplatin AUC 5 + Etoposide (if cisplatin not tolerated)
     - Thoracic radiation 45Gy BID or 60-70Gy daily
     - Start radiation with cycle 1-2

  2. Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)
     - If complete or partial response
     - Reduces brain mets from 40% to 15%
     - 25 Gy in 10 fractions
     - Cognitive effects possible

Response:
  - CR/PR in 80-90% of patients
  - Median survival: 17-23 months
  - 2-year survival: 20-40%
  - High relapse rate
```

**Extensive Stage SCLC**:
```
Treatment Intent: Palliative (not curative)

First-Line:
  Carboplatin AUC 5 D1 + Etoposide 100mg/m² D1-3 q3w × 4 cycles
  PLUS Atezolizumab 1200mg D1 q3w (or durvalumab 1500mg q3w)

  Then: Atezolizumab (or durvalumab) maintenance until progression

Second-Line (platinum-sensitive, ≥3 months):
  Rechallenge with platinum-etoposide ± immunotherapy

Second-Line (platinum-resistant, <3 months):
  - Topotecan 1.5mg/m² D1-5 q3w
  - OR Lurbinectedin 3.2mg/m² q3w

Prognosis:
  - Median survival: 12-14 months (with immunotherapy)
  - High initial response but rapid progression common
```

### Brain Metastases in Lung Cancer

Lung cancer has the highest rate of brain metastases of any solid tumor.

**Incidence**:
```
At diagnosis:
  - NSCLC: 10-20%
  - SCLC: 10-15% (limited), 15-25% (extensive)
  - EGFR/ALK positive: Higher rates

During disease course:
  - NSCLC: 30-50%
  - SCLC: 50-80%
```

**Presentation**:
- Headache, worse in morning
- Focal neurologic deficits
- Seizures
- Cognitive changes
- Often asymptomatic (found on staging MRI)

**Management**:
```
Symptomatic:
  - Dexamethasone 4-8mg q6h (edema reduction)
  - Antiepileptics if seizures (levetiracetam preferred)

Limited brain mets (1-4 lesions, good performance status):
  - Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS): 15-24 Gy single fraction
  - High local control (80-90%)
  - Preserve cognition

Multiple brain mets or poor performance status:
  - Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT): 30 Gy in 10 fractions
  - More cognitive impact than SRS
  - Consider hippocampal-sparing WBRT

With targetable driver:
  - CNS-penetrant TKIs first:
    - Osimertinib (EGFR) - excellent CNS activity
    - Alectinib, lorlatinib (ALK) - excellent CNS activity
    - Entrectinib (ROS1, NTRK) - good CNS activity
  - May defer radiation if CNS controlled on TKI
```
