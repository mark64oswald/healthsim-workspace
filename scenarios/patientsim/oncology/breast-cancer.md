# Breast Cancer Management

Comprehensive scenario skill for generating realistic breast cancer patient journeys, from screening detection through treatment, surveillance, and survivorship or metastatic management.

## For Claude

Use this skill when generating breast cancer patients across the care continuum. This teaches you how to generate **realistic clinical event sequences** for breast cancer patients - from abnormal mammogram through biopsy, staging, treatment, and long-term follow-up.

**When to apply this skill:**
- User mentions breast cancer, breast mass, or abnormal mammogram
- User requests oncology patients requiring chemotherapy, radiation, or hormonal therapy
- User specifies ER/PR/HER2 status or molecular subtypes
- User asks for mastectomy, lumpectomy, or breast surgery scenarios
- User mentions tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, or Herceptin
- User needs survivorship or metastatic breast cancer scenarios
- User requests multi-disciplinary oncology care workflows

**Key capabilities this skill provides:**
- How to generate complete treatment timelines (diagnosis → staging → surgery → systemic therapy → surveillance)
- How to match molecular subtype with appropriate treatment regimen
- How to create realistic biomarker profiles (ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67)
- How to sequence multi-modality treatment (neoadjuvant vs adjuvant approach)
- How to model treatment toxicity and supportive care needs
- How to structure surveillance schedules by treatment phase
- How to generate metastatic progression with appropriate sites and treatment lines

**Important**: Molecular subtype determines treatment. ER+ patients need hormonal therapy. HER2+ patients need trastuzumab. Triple-negative patients need chemotherapy. Always ensure treatment matches the biomarker profile.

## Purpose

This scenario generates realistic breast cancer patients across the disease spectrum, from screen-detected early-stage cancers through metastatic disease. It simulates the multi-disciplinary approach to breast cancer care including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy.

The scenario is designed to:
- Model realistic breast cancer presentations and detection pathways
- Generate appropriate staging workups and biomarker testing
- Simulate treatment planning based on molecular subtype
- Support different disease phases (newly diagnosed, active treatment, surveillance, recurrence, metastatic)
- Include realistic treatment toxicity patterns and supportive care
- Cover survivorship care planning and long-term follow-up

## Domain Knowledge

### Molecular Subtype Profiles

Breast cancer is classified by receptor status, which determines treatment and prognosis.

**Why this matters for generation**: The molecular subtype drives the entire treatment plan. Never give trastuzumab to a HER2-negative patient. Never skip hormonal therapy in an ER+ patient.

**Luminal A (ER+/PR+/HER2-/Ki-67 low)**:
- Most common subtype (~40% of breast cancers)
- Best prognosis
- Hormone-responsive
- Treatment: Surgery → Radiation (if lumpectomy) → Hormonal therapy 5-10 years
- Chemotherapy: Often NOT needed (use Oncotype DX to guide)
- Typical Oncotype DX score: Low (0-25)

**Luminal B (ER+/PR+/-/HER2-/Ki-67 high or ER+/HER2+)**:
- ~20% of breast cancers
- Intermediate prognosis
- More aggressive than Luminal A
- Treatment: Surgery → Chemotherapy → Radiation → Hormonal therapy
- If HER2+: Add trastuzumab ± pertuzumab
- Typical Oncotype DX score: Intermediate to High (16-100)

**HER2-Enriched (ER-/PR-/HER2+)**:
- ~10-15% of breast cancers
- Aggressive but highly targetable
- Requires HER2-directed therapy
- Treatment: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + HER2 therapy → Surgery → Continue HER2 therapy
- Regimens: TCHP (neoadjuvant), TCH (adjuvant)
- 1 year of trastuzumab standard

**Triple-Negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-)**:
- ~15-20% of breast cancers
- Most aggressive subtype
- No targeted therapy (no hormonal, no HER2)
- Treatment: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy → Surgery → Radiation
- May benefit from immunotherapy if PD-L1+
- BRCA testing important (PARP inhibitors if positive)
- Higher recurrence risk in first 3 years

### Biomarker-Treatment Coherence

Treatment must match biomarker status.

**Coherence Rules**:
```python
if ER_positive or PR_positive:
    must_have_hormonal_therapy = True
    # Tamoxifen (premenopausal) or Aromatase inhibitor (postmenopausal)
    duration = "5-10 years"

if HER2_positive:
    must_have_HER2_directed_therapy = True
    # Trastuzumab ± pertuzumab
    duration = "1 year"
    monitor_cardiac_function = True  # ECHO every 3 months

if triple_negative:
    no_targeted_therapy = True
    chemotherapy_is_mainstay = True
    consider_immunotherapy_if_PD_L1_positive = True
    test_BRCA_for_PARP_inhibitor_eligibility = True

if ER_positive and stage_I_or_II:
    consider_Oncotype_DX = True
    if Oncotype_score <= 25:
        may_omit_chemotherapy = True
```

### Staging and Workup

**Initial Diagnostic Workup**:
```
1. Imaging mammogram/ultrasound → suspicious finding
2. Core needle biopsy → confirms invasive carcinoma
3. Pathology:
   - Histologic type (ductal, lobular)
   - Grade (1-3)
   - ER/PR by IHC (% positive cells)
   - HER2 by IHC (0, 1+, 2+, 3+)
   - HER2 FISH if IHC 2+ (equivocal)
   - Ki-67 (proliferation index)
4. Staging imaging (if locally advanced or symptomatic):
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   - Bone scan or PET/CT
5. Genetic counseling/testing if indicated:
   - Age <50
   - Triple-negative
   - Family history
   - Ashkenazi Jewish heritage
```

**TNM Staging for Breast Cancer (AJCC 8th Edition)**:

| Stage | T | N | M | Description |
|-------|---|---|---|-------------|
| 0 | Tis | N0 | M0 | DCIS (carcinoma in situ) |
| IA | T1 | N0 | M0 | ≤2cm, no nodes |
| IB | T0-1 | N1mi | M0 | Micrometastases only |
| IIA | T0-1 | N1 | M0 | ≤2cm with 1-3 nodes |
| IIA | T2 | N0 | M0 | 2-5cm, no nodes |
| IIB | T2 | N1 | M0 | 2-5cm with 1-3 nodes |
| IIB | T3 | N0 | M0 | >5cm, no nodes |
| IIIA | T0-2 | N2 | M0 | 4-9 nodes involved |
| IIIA | T3 | N1-2 | M0 | >5cm with nodes |
| IIIB | T4 | N0-2 | M0 | Chest wall or skin involvement |
| IIIC | Any T | N3 | M0 | ≥10 nodes or infra/supraclavicular |
| IV | Any T | Any N | M1 | Distant metastases |

### Treatment Pathways by Stage

**Stage 0 (DCIS)**:
- Surgery: Lumpectomy with radiation OR mastectomy
- Hormonal therapy: Tamoxifen 5 years (if ER+) - optional
- No chemotherapy needed

**Stage I-II (Early Stage)**:
```
ER+/HER2- (Luminal A/B):
  1. Surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy)
  2. Oncotype DX if node-negative (to guide chemo decision)
  3. Chemotherapy if high Oncotype score or node-positive
  4. Radiation if lumpectomy
  5. Hormonal therapy 5-10 years

HER2+ (Any ER status):
  1. Neoadjuvant TCHP (6 cycles) - preferred for Stage II+
  2. Surgery
  3. Adjuvant trastuzumab ± pertuzumab (complete 1 year total)
  4. Radiation if lumpectomy
  5. Hormonal therapy if ER+ (5-10 years)

Triple-Negative:
  1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AC-T or carboplatin-containing)
  2. Surgery
  3. If residual disease: capecitabine 6-8 cycles
  4. Radiation if lumpectomy
  5. Consider pembrolizumab if PD-L1+
```

**Stage III (Locally Advanced)**:
```
All subtypes typically receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy:
  1. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (allows tumor response assessment)
  2. Surgery (mastectomy more common)
  3. Radiation to chest wall and regional nodes
  4. Complete systemic therapy per subtype
  5. Assess pathologic complete response (pCR)
```

**Stage IV (Metastatic)**:
```
Treatment intent: Palliative (not curative)
Goals: Prolong survival, maintain quality of life, control symptoms

ER+/HER2-:
  1. First-line: CDK4/6 inhibitor + AI (palbociclib + letrozole)
  2. Second-line: Fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor
  3. Later lines: Chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin)

HER2+:
  1. First-line: Taxane + trastuzumab + pertuzumab
  2. Second-line: T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine)
  3. Third-line: T-DXd (trastuzumab deruxtecan)

Triple-Negative:
  1. First-line: Chemotherapy ± pembrolizumab (if PD-L1+)
  2. Second-line: Different chemotherapy agent
  3. If BRCA+: PARP inhibitor (olaparib)
```

  - Cataracts

Aromatase Inhibitors:
  - Arthralgias/myalgias (30-50%)
  - Bone loss/osteoporosis
  - Hot flashes
  - Vaginal dryness
```

**Trastuzumab Cardiotoxicity**:
- LVEF decline (usually reversible)
- Monitor ECHO every 3 months
- Hold if LVEF <50% or drops >16% from baseline
- Can often resume when LVEF recovers

### Common Metastatic Sites

Breast cancer commonly metastasizes to:

| Site | Frequency | Symptoms | Workup |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Bone | 70% | Pain, fracture | Bone scan, CT |
| Liver | 40% | RUQ pain, LFT elevation | CT, MRI |
| Lung | 30% | Dyspnea, cough | CT chest |
| Brain | 15% | Headache, neuro deficits | MRI brain |
| Pleura | 10% | Dyspnea, effusion | CT, thoracentesis |

**HER2+ and Triple-Negative have higher rates of brain metastases**

## Generation Guidelines

### How to Apply This Knowledge

**When the user says**: "Generate a breast cancer patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Select subtype**: Luminal A (most common) unless specified
2. **Choose stage**: Stage II (typical at diagnosis)
3. **Generate biomarkers**:
   ```python
   if subtype == "luminal_a":
       ER = "positive (95%)"
       PR = "positive (80%)"
       HER2 = "negative (IHC 1+)"
       Ki67 = "10% (low)"
       grade = 2
   ```
4. **Select treatment pathway**:
   - Surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy)
   - Radiation if lumpectomy
   - Oncotype DX to guide chemotherapy decision
   - Hormonal therapy 5-10 years
5. **Generate realistic timeline**

**When the user says**: "Generate a HER2-positive breast cancer patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Set biomarkers**:
   ```python
   HER2 = "positive (IHC 3+)"
   ER = randomly_select(["positive (70%)", "negative"])
   PR = randomly_select(["positive", "negative"])
   ```
2. **Select treatment**:
   - Neoadjuvant TCHP × 6 cycles (preferred approach)
   - Surgery
   - Continue trastuzumab ± pertuzumab to complete 1 year
   - Radiation if lumpectomy
   - Hormonal therapy if ER+
3. **Include cardiac monitoring**: ECHO at baseline, q3mo during HER2 therapy
4. **Document pathologic response**: pCR vs residual disease

**When the user says**: "Generate a metastatic breast cancer patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Set stage**: IV
2. **Choose metastatic sites**: Bone (most common), liver, lung, brain
3. **Include both primary and metastatic codes**:
   ```python
   primary_code = "C50.911"  # Right breast
   metastatic_codes = ["C79.51"]  # Bone mets
   ```
4. **Select treatment based on subtype**:
   - ER+: CDK4/6 inhibitor + AI first-line
   - HER2+: Taxane + trastuzumab + pertuzumab
   - TNBC: Chemotherapy ± immunotherapy
5. **Set treatment intent**: Palliative
6. **Include line of therapy** (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

# 3. Surgical approach coherence
if had_lumpectomy:
    assert has_radiation_therapy, "Lumpectomy requires radiation"
if stage == "IV":
    assert surgical_approach in ["none", "palliative"], "Stage IV rarely surgical"

# 4. Chemotherapy regimen coherence
if regimen == "TCHP":
    assert HER2_positive, "TCHP only for HER2+"
if regimen == "AC-T":
    assert suitable_for_anthracycline, "Check cardiac history"

# 5. Timeline coherence
if neoadjuvant_chemotherapy:

shared_considerations:
  - Baseline ECHO before anthracycline
  - Cumulative doxorubicin dose tracking (limit 450-550 mg/m²)
  - LVEF decline triggers:
    - <50%: Hold chemotherapy
    - >10% drop from baseline: Cardiology consultation
  - Switch to non-anthracycline regimen (TC instead of AC)
  - Cardio-oncology referral
example_scenario:
  - Baseline LVEF 60%
  - After AC cycle 3: LVEF 48%
  - Action: Hold doxorubicin, switch to taxane-only
  - Cardiology referral, consider ACE inhibitor
```

### Breast Cancer with HER2 Therapy Cardiotoxicity
```yaml
description: Trastuzumab-induced LVEF decline
shared_considerations:
