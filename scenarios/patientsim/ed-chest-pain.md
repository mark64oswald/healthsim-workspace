# Emergency Department Chest Pain Scenario - Complete Event Timelines

A scenario template for generating patients presenting to the Emergency Department with chest pain **with complete event sequences from symptom onset through disposition**, covering the spectrum from benign musculoskeletal pain to acute myocardial infarction.

## For Claude

Use this skill when the user requests ED chest pain patients or cardiac workup scenarios. This teaches you how to generate **realistic clinical event sequences** for chest pain presentations across the risk spectrum - from low-risk rule-outs to STEMI requiring emergent intervention.

**When to apply this skill:**
- User mentions chest pain, cardiac presentation, or ED scenarios
- User requests MI, STEMI, NSTEMI, or acute coronary syndrome patients
- User specifies troponin levels, ECG changes, or cardiac workup
- User asks for emergency department or acute care scenarios with event timelines
- User mentions "rule out MI" or cardiac risk stratification
- User needs event sequences for testing clinical decision support or workflow protocols

**Key capabilities this skill provides:**
- How to generate complete event timelines (symptom onset → EMS → ED arrival → diagnostic workup → treatment → disposition)
- How to match ECG findings with troponin levels at specific time points (STEMI vs NSTEMI vs rule-out)
- How to apply HEART score risk stratification throughout the ED course
- How to create time-critical sequences (door-to-balloon <90 min for STEMI, serial troponins 3h apart)
- How to sequence lab orders → results → clinical decisions → treatment interventions
- When to activate cath lab emergently vs admit to cardiology vs discharge
- How to create alert-triggering events (troponin rising, ST elevations appearing)

**Important**: STEMI requires **immediate** cath lab activation (ST elevations ≥1mm in 2 contiguous leads). NSTEMI has elevated troponin but NO ST elevations. Rule-out has negative troponins and normal/non-diagnostic ECG. All scenarios should include **temporal sequences** showing progression of events.

## Domain Knowledge

### Chest Pain Diagnostic Spectrum

Chest pain exists on a spectrum from benign (musculoskeletal) to immediately life-threatening (STEMI). The critical skill is recognizing where on this spectrum the patient falls.

**Why this matters for generation**: The final diagnosis determines ECG findings, troponin levels, symptoms severity, vital signs, and the entire clinical timeline. These elements must be coherent.

**Rule-Out / Low Risk**:
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes
- Troponin: Negative at 0h and 3h (<0.04 ng/mL)
- Symptoms: Atypical (sharp, positional, reproducible with palpation)
- Vitals: Normal
- Disposition: Discharge with outpatient follow-up

**Unstable Angina**:
- ECG: May show ST depressions or T wave changes
- Troponin: NEGATIVE (by definition)
- Symptoms: Typical anginal (substernal pressure, radiation)
- Risk: High risk for MI despite negative troponin
- Disposition: Admit to cardiology, early cath

**NSTEMI** (Non-ST Elevation MI):
- ECG: ST depressions, T wave inversions, or non-specific changes
- Troponin: ELEVATED and RISING (diagnostic)
- Symptoms: Typical anginal, ongoing or recent
- Disposition: Admit to CCU, cath within 24-72h

**STEMI** (ST Elevation MI):
- ECG: ST elevations ≥1mm in 2 contiguous limb leads OR ≥2mm in 2 contiguous precordial leads
- Troponin: Elevated (but don't wait for results)
- Symptoms: Severe, crushing chest pain
- **TIME-CRITICAL**: Activate cath lab immediately, door-to-balloon <90 min
- Disposition: Emergent PCI, then CCU

### ECG-Troponin Coherence

The ECG and troponin must tell the same story.

**Coherence Rules**:
```python
if ECG_shows_ST_elevations_meeting_criteria:
    diagnosis = "STEMI"
    troponin_will_be_elevated = True
    action = "IMMEDIATE cath lab activation"
    do_not_wait_for_troponin_results()

elif troponin_elevated and ECG_normal_or_nonspecific:
    diagnosis = "NSTEMI"
    expect_ST_depressions_or_T_wave_inversions = possible
    action = "Admit to cardiology, cath within 24-72h"

elif ECG_shows_ST_depressions and troponin_negative:
    diagnosis = "Unstable angina"
    action = "Admit, high-risk, early invasive strategy"

elif troponin_negative_x2 and ECG_normal:
    diagnosis = "Low risk, likely rule-out"
    check_HEART_score()
    if HEART_score <= 3:
        disposition = "Discharge with outpatient follow-up"
```

**Why this matters for generation**: Never generate a patient with ST elevations who has negative troponin and gets discharged. Never generate NSTEMI without elevated troponin. The ECG and labs must match the diagnosis.

### STEMI Recognition and Response

STEMI is a medical emergency requiring immediate action.

**STEMI Criteria** (any one meets criteria):
- ST elevation ≥1mm in 2 contiguous limb leads (e.g., II, III, aVF for inferior MI)
- ST elevation ≥2mm in 2 contiguous precordial leads (e.g., V1-V4 for anterior MI)
- New left bundle branch block (Sgarbossa criteria)
- ST depressions V1-V3 with tall R waves (posterior MI)

**STEMI Territories**:
- **Inferior STEMI**: ST elevations in II, III, aVF → Right coronary artery
- **Anterior STEMI**: ST elevations in V1-V4 → Left anterior descending artery
- **Lateral STEMI**: ST elevations in I, aVL, V5-V6 → Left circumflex artery
- **Posterior STEMI**: ST depressions V1-V3, tall R waves → Posterior descending artery

**STEMI Timeline** (time-critical):
```python
arrival = 0_min
ECG_obtained = 5_min  # Within 10 min of arrival
STEMI_recognized = 5_min
code_STEMI_activated = 7_min  # Immediately
cath_lab_team_paged = 7_min
aspirin_ticagrelor_heparin_given = 10_min
patient_to_cath_lab = 25_min
balloon_inflation = 60_min  # GOAL: Door-to-balloon <90 min

# If STEMI patient doesn't follow this timeline, something is wrong
```

**Why this matters for generation**: STEMI is defined by ECG, not troponin. The moment you see ST elevations, CODE STEMI is activated. Don't generate STEMI patients with delayed recognition or treatment.

### Risk Stratification: HEART Score

The HEART score stratifies chest pain patients into low, intermediate, and high risk.

**HEART Score Components**:
1. **History**: Highly suspicious (2), Moderately suspicious (1), Slightly suspicious (0)
2. **ECG**: ST depression (2), Non-specific repolarization (1), Normal (0)
3. **Age**: ≥65 (2), 45-65 (1), <45 (0)
4. **Risk Factors**: ≥3 factors (2), 1-2 factors (1), None (0)
5. **Troponin**: ≥3x normal (2), 1-3x normal (1), Normal (0)

**Interpretation**:
- **Score 0-3**: Low risk (2% MACE) → consider discharge with outpatient stress test
- **Score 4-6**: Intermediate risk (12% MACE) → admit for observation
- **Score 7-10**: High risk (65% MACE) → admit, early invasive strategy

**Example Application**:
```python
patient = {
    "history": "substernal pressure, radiation to arm, diaphoresis",  # Highly suspicious = 2
    "ECG": "ST depressions 1mm in V4-V6",  # ST depression = 2
    "age": 67,  # ≥65 = 2
    "risk_factors": ["HTN", "diabetes", "smoking"],  # ≥3 = 2
    "troponin": 4.5,  # ≥3x normal = 2
}
HEART_score = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10  # High risk - admit, cath lab
```

**Why this matters for generation**: Use HEART score to justify disposition. Low HEART score → discharge. High HEART score → admit and cath.

### Troponin Kinetics

Troponin rises and falls in a predictable pattern after MI.

**Timeline**:
- **Hour 0**: May be normal or mildly elevated
- **Hour 3-6**: Peak troponin (highest levels)
- **Hour 12-24**: Starts declining
- **Day 3-10**: Returns to normal

**Serial Troponins**:
- Initial troponin at presentation (hour 0)
- Repeat troponin at hour 3 (standard for rule-out)
- If rising (e.g., 0.5 → 3.2 → 8.5), confirms ongoing MI

**Magnitude**:
- <0.04 ng/mL: Normal (negative)
- 0.04-0.5 ng/mL: Mildly elevated (demand ischemia, small MI)
- 0.5-15 ng/mL: Elevated (NSTEMI range)
- >15 ng/mL: Markedly elevated (large STEMI)

**Why this matters for generation**: Troponin must rise over time in MI. Generate serial troponins that are coherent (e.g., 0.8 → 3.5 → 9.2, not 5.0 → 2.0 → 8.0).

### Cardiac Risk Factors

Cardiac risk factors increase probability of ACS and influence HEART score.

**Major Risk Factors**:
- Hypertension (60% of chest pain patients)
- Hyperlipidemia (50%)
- Diabetes mellitus (30%)
- Smoking (current 30%, former 40%)
- Family history of early CAD (35%)
- Known CAD or prior MI

**Risk Factor Clustering**:
```python
if age > 60:
    probability_has_HTN = 0.65
    probability_has_hyperlipidemia = 0.55
    probability_has_diabetes = 0.30

if has_diabetes:
    # Diabetics often have multiple risk factors
    also_has_HTN = 0.75
    also_has_hyperlipidemia = 0.70
```

**Why this matters for generation**: High-risk patients (multiple risk factors, older) should have higher probability of actual MI. Low-risk patients (young, no risk factors) more likely to be rule-outs.

### Medications and Timing

Cardiac medications must be given in correct sequence and timing.

**ED Treatment for STEMI** (time-critical):
```python
arrival_time = 0
aspirin_325mg_chewed = 5_min  # Immediately
ticagrelor_180mg_or_clopidogrel_600mg = 10_min  # Dual antiplatelet
heparin_bolus_60_units_per_kg = 10_min
nitroglycerin_SL_if_pain_ongoing = 12_min
morphine_IV_if_severe_pain = 15_min  # Caution: may mask symptoms
metoprolol_5mg_IV_if_not_contraindicated = 20_min
to_cath_lab = 25_min
```

**ED Treatment for NSTEMI/Unstable Angina**:
- Aspirin 325mg PO
- Ticagrelor 180mg PO (or clopidogrel 600mg)
- Heparin drip or enoxaparin 1mg/kg SQ Q12H
- Nitroglycerin drip for ongoing chest pain
- Metoprolol 25-50mg PO Q6H
- Atorvastatin 80mg PO (high-intensity statin)
- Admit to cardiology service

**Why this matters for generation**: Don't give beta-blockers to STEMI patients with bradycardia or hypotension. Don't give morphine before aspirin. Timing matters.

## Generation Guidelines

### How to Apply This Knowledge

**When the user says**: "Generate an ED chest pain patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Determine risk level**: Default to intermediate risk (HEART score 4-6)
2. **Select outcome**: Rule-out (40%), NSTEMI (30%), unstable angina (20%), STEMI (10%)
3. **Generate coherent findings**:
   ```python
   if outcome == "rule-out":
       ECG = "normal sinus rhythm, no ST changes"
       troponin_0h = "<0.04 ng/mL"
       troponin_3h = "<0.04 ng/mL"
       symptoms = "atypical - sharp, positional"
       HEART_score = 2-3  # Low risk
       disposition = "discharge with cardiology follow-up"
   ```
4. **Add appropriate risk factors**: Age 55, HTN, hyperlipidemia
5. **Create realistic timeline**: Arrival → ECG (10 min) → Labs sent (20 min) → Results (90 min)

**When the user says**: "Generate a STEMI patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **Select MI territory**: Inferior (most common) or anterior
2. **Generate diagnostic ECG**:
   ```python
   if territory == "inferior":
       ECG = "ST elevations 3-4mm in II, III, aVF"
       reciprocal_changes = "ST depressions in I, aVL"
       culprit_artery = "Right coronary artery"
   elif territory == "anterior":
       ECG = "ST elevations 4-6mm in V1-V4"
       culprit_artery = "Left anterior descending"
   ```
3. **Make troponin coherent**: Will be elevated, but DON'T WAIT for results
4. **Create time-critical timeline**:
   - Arrival → 0 min
   - ECG obtained → 5 min
   - CODE STEMI activated → 7 min
   - Door-to-balloon → <90 min (ideally 60 min)
5. **Severe symptoms**: "Crushing" chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, dyspnea
6. **Disposition**: Emergent PCI → CCU

**When the user says**: "Generate an NSTEMI patient"

**Claude should**:
1. **ECG findings**: ST depressions or T wave inversions (NOT ST elevations)
2. **Troponin**: Elevated and rising
   ```python
   troponin_0h = 3.8  # Elevated
   troponin_3h = 9.2  # Rising (confirms ongoing MI)
   ```
3. **Symptoms**: Typical anginal (substernal pressure, radiation, diaphoresis)
4. **Timeline**: Not as time-critical as STEMI, but admit to cardiology
5. **Disposition**: CCU admission, cardiac cath within 24-72h

### Coherence Checks

Before finalizing a chest pain patient, verify:

```python
# 1. STEMI criteria
if has_ST_elevations_meeting_criteria:
    assert diagnosis == "STEMI"
    assert code_STEMI_activated == True
    assert door_to_balloon_time < 90_min
    assert NOT_sent_to_floor  # Must go to cath lab

# 2. Troponin-diagnosis coherence
if diagnosis == "NSTEMI":
    assert troponin > 0.04  # Must be elevated
    assert troponin_rising  # Serial troponins should increase
    assert NO_ST_elevations  # NSTEMI by definition

if diagnosis == "rule-out":
    assert troponin_0h < 0.04 and troponin_3h < 0.04
    assert ECG_normal_or_nonspecific

# 3. HEART score and disposition alignment
if HEART_score <= 3:
    disposition_should_be_discharge_with_follow_up()
if HEART_score >= 7:
    disposition_should_be_admit_early_cath()

# 4. Symptom-severity coherence
if diagnosis == "STEMI":
    assert pain_severity >= 8  # Severe
    assert has_diaphoresis  # Common
if diagnosis == "rule-out" and pain_severity >= 9:
    reconsider_diagnosis()  # Severe pain unusual for rule-out
```
