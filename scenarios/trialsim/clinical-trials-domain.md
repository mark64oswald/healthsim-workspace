# Clinical Trials Domain Knowledge

## Overview

This skill provides foundational domain knowledge for generating realistic clinical trial data. It covers regulatory frameworks, trial design patterns, CDISC standards, and data generation rules that ensure synthetic trial data is plausible and standards-compliant.

## Trial Phases

### Phase I - Safety and Pharmacokinetics

**Purpose:** Establish initial safety profile and determine dosing

| Characteristic | Typical Value |
|----------------|---------------|
| Subject Count | 20-100 |
| Duration | 6-12 months |
| Population | Healthy volunteers (or patients for oncology) |
| Primary Endpoints | MTD, DLT, PK parameters |
| Design | Dose escalation (3+3, mTPI, BOIN) |

**Key Data Elements:**
- Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)
- Pharmacokinetic sampling (dense PK)
- Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination
- Single ascending dose (SAD) / Multiple ascending dose (MAD)

### Phase II - Efficacy Signal and Dose Selection

**Purpose:** Evaluate efficacy and refine dosing

| Characteristic | Typical Value |
|----------------|---------------|
| Subject Count | 100-300 |
| Duration | 1-2 years |
| Population | Patients with target condition |
| Primary Endpoints | Efficacy biomarker, response rate |
| Design | Randomized, controlled (may be single-arm in oncology) |

**Key Data Elements:**
- Preliminary efficacy signals
- Dose-response relationship
- Safety in target population
- Optimal dose selection for Phase III

### Phase III - Confirmatory/Pivotal

**Purpose:** Confirm efficacy and safety for registration

| Characteristic | Typical Value |
|----------------|---------------|
| Subject Count | 300-3000+ |
| Duration | 2-4 years |
| Population | Broader patient population |
| Primary Endpoints | Clinical outcomes, PROs |
| Design | Randomized, double-blind, controlled |

**Key Data Elements:**
- Primary efficacy endpoint(s)
- Comprehensive safety database
- Subgroup analyses
- Risk-benefit assessment

### Phase IV - Post-Marketing

**Purpose:** Long-term safety, real-world effectiveness

| Characteristic | Typical Value |
|----------------|---------------|
| Subject Count | 1000-10000+ |
| Duration | Years |
| Population | Broad, real-world |
| Primary Endpoints | Safety signals, effectiveness |
| Design | Observational, pragmatic |

**Key Data Elements:**
- Rare adverse events
- Long-term outcomes
- Drug utilization patterns
- Comparative effectiveness

## Trial Design Types

### Parallel Design

Standard design with subjects randomized to treatment arms maintained throughout.

```
Randomization
    ├── Arm A (Treatment) ──────────────────► End of Study
    └── Arm B (Control) ────────────────────► End of Study
```

**Use When:** Standard efficacy/safety evaluation

### Crossover Design

Subjects receive both treatments in sequence with washout period.

```
Randomization
    ├── Sequence AB: Treatment A → Washout → Treatment B → End
    └── Sequence BA: Treatment B → Washout → Treatment A → End
```

**Use When:**
- Chronic, stable conditions
- Treatments with reversible effects
- Reduced sample size needed

### Adaptive Design

Prospectively planned modifications based on interim data.

**Types:**
- Sample size re-estimation
- Response adaptive randomization
- Seamless Phase II/III
- Biomarker-driven enrichment

### Decentralized Trials (DCT)

Remote/hybrid trials with reduced site visits.

**Elements:**
- eConsent
- Remote monitoring devices
- Telemedicine visits
- Home health visits
- Direct-to-patient drug shipping

### Master Protocols

**Basket Trial:** Single drug, multiple tumor types
**Umbrella Trial:** Single tumor type, multiple drugs
**Platform Trial:** Multiple drugs, adaptive additions/graduations

## CDISC Standards Overview

### CDASH (Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization)

Standard for data collection on Case Report Forms (CRFs).

**Key Concepts:**
- Core variables (highly recommended)
- Supplemental variables (recommended)
- Common data collection standards

### SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model)

Standard for organizing raw collected data.

**Structure:**
- Domains (datasets for related data)
- Variables (columns with standard names)
- Controlled terminology (standard values)
- Define-XML (metadata specification)

### ADaM (Analysis Data Model)

Standard for analysis-ready datasets.

**Key Datasets:**
- ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)
- ADAE (Adverse Events Analysis Dataset)
- ADTTE (Time-to-Event Analysis Dataset)
- BDS (Basic Data Structure) for findings

**Key Variables:**
- PARAMCD/PARAM (parameter identification)
- AVAL/AVALC (analysis values)
- ANL01FL (analysis population flags)
- BASE, CHG (baseline and change)

### Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Criteria

An AE is serious if it:
- Results in death
- Is life-threatening
- Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation
- Results in persistent/significant disability
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
- Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment

### Common AE Distribution by Phase

| Phase | Overall AE Rate | SAE Rate | Discontinuation for AE |

| General disorders | 50% |
| Skin and subcutaneous tissue | 40% |
| Infections and infestations | 35% |
| Blood and lymphatic system | 30% |

|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Completed | COMPLETED | 70-85% |
| Adverse Event | ADVERSE EVENT | 3-8% |
| Disease Progression | DISEASE PROGRESSION | 5-15% |
| Withdrawal by Subject | WITHDRAWAL BY SUBJECT | 2-5% |
| Lost to Follow-up | LOST TO FOLLOW-UP | 1-3% |
| Protocol Deviation | PROTOCOL DEVIATION | 1-2% |
| Death | DEATH | 0-5% |
| Physician Decision | PHYSICIAN DECISION | 1-2% |

### Timing Patterns

- Early discontinuation (first 25% of study): Higher in Phase I
- Mid-study discontinuation: Often disease progression
- Late discontinuation: Mostly completed, some AE-related
