# Phase III Pivotal Trial Scenario

## Overview

Generate realistic Phase III pivotal trial data suitable for:
- FDA submission package testing (NDA/BLA)
- Clinical data management system validation
- SDTM/ADaM transformation testing
- Statistical analysis workflow development
- EDC system testing

Phase III trials are confirmatory studies designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety in a broad patient population to support regulatory approval.

## Generation Examples

### Example 1: Small Phase III Trial

**Request:** "Generate a Phase III trial with 50 subjects across 5 sites"

Claude will generate:
- Study definition with 50 planned subjects
- 5 sites (1-2 high enrollers, 3-4 average)
- 50 subjects with full demographics
- Visits per schedule (8+ per subject = 400+ visit records)
- ~30 subjects with at least one AE
- ~4 subjects with SAEs
- ~7-8 early discontinuations

### Example 2: Oncology Trial with SDTM Output

**Request:** "Generate a Phase III NSCLC trial with 10 subjects, output as SDTM DM and AE"

Claude will:
1. Generate canonical trial data
2. Transform subjects to DM domain variables
3. Transform adverse events to AE domain variables
4. Output SDTM-formatted CSV content

### Example 3: Safety Database for Specific Signal

**Request:** "Generate Phase III trial data with high rate of hepatotoxicity events"

Claude will:
- Increase liver-related AE frequency (25% vs typical 5%)
- Include ALT/AST elevations in lab data
- Add Hy's Law cases (2-3 subjects)
- Appropriate discontinuation for hepatotoxicity

## Validation Rules

TrialSim validates Phase III data for:

1. **Enrollment Logic**
   - Consent before randomization
   - Screening within window
   - Site enrollment within capacity

2. **Visit Compliance**
   - Visits within protocol windows
   - Required assessments present
   - Proper sequence (no Week 8 before Week 4)

3. **Safety Data**
   - AE dates within treatment period
   - SAE criteria properly applied
   - Causality consistent with timing

4. **Efficacy Data**
   - Assessment dates match visit schedule
   - Response criteria properly derived
   - Progression documented correctly

5. **Disposition**
   - End date after all other dates
   - Reason consistent with data (e.g., AE if discontinued for AE)
   - Death date matches fatal AE date
