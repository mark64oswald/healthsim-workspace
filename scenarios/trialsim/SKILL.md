# TrialSim - Clinical Trial Data Generation

## Overview

TrialSim generates realistic synthetic clinical trial data for pharmaceutical and biologics/cell & gene therapy trials. It produces CDISC-compliant formats (SDTM, ADaM) suitable for FDA submission testing, clinical data management system validation, and analytics platform development.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Study protocol definitions with treatment arms and visit schedules
- Multi-site enrollment with realistic recruitment patterns
- Subject randomization and treatment assignment
- Scheduled and unscheduled visit data
- Adverse event generation with severity and causality
- Efficacy endpoint measurements
- Disposition and discontinuation patterns
- CDISC SDTM and ADaM output formats

## Cross-Product Integration

### Patient to Subject Transformation

TrialSim subjects extend PatientSim patients:

```
PatientSim Patient          TrialSim Subject
├── person_id        →      ├── person_id (same)
├── mrn              →      ├── mrn (if available)
├── demographics     →      ├── demographics
├── medical_history  →      ├── medical_history (MH domain)
└── medications      →      └── concomitant_meds (CM domain)
                            ├── subject_id (USUBJID)
                            ├── consent_date (RFICDTC)
                            ├── randomization_date (RANDDT)
                            ├── treatment_arm (ARM/ACTARM)
                            └── trial_status
```

### Claims Integration (MemberSim)

Trial-related healthcare services generate claims:
- Screening visits → Professional claims
- Treatment administration → Facility claims (if infusion)
- Lab work → Lab claims
- Serious adverse events → Inpatient claims

### Pharmacy Integration (RxMemberSim)

- Concomitant medications appear in pharmacy claims
- Study drug is tracked separately (not in pharmacy claims)

See [clinical-trials-domain.md](clinical-trials-domain.md) for detailed SDTM specifications.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Phase III Trial

**Request:** "Generate a small Phase III oncology trial with 10 subjects"

**Output:** See [../../hello-healthsim/trialsim-quickstart.md](../../hello-healthsim/trialsim-quickstart.md)

### Example 2: With SDTM Output

**Request:** "Generate trial data and output as SDTM DM and AE domains"

Claude will:
1. Generate canonical trial data
2. Transform to SDTM format
3. Output DM.csv and AE.csv with proper variable names

## Validation Rules

TrialSim validates generated data for:

1. **Protocol Compliance**: Visits within windows, required assessments present
2. **Temporal Consistency**: Consent → Randomization → Treatment → Disposition
3. **CDISC Conformance**: Variable names, controlled terminology, required fields
4. **Clinical Plausibility**: Age-appropriate conditions, realistic lab ranges
5. **Referential Integrity**: Subject IDs consistent across domains
