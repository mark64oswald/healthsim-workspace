# TrialSim

> Generate realistic clinical trial data including study definitions, subjects, visits, adverse events, efficacy assessments, and CDISC-compliant output.

## What TrialSim Does

TrialSim is the **clinical trial data** engine of HealthSim. It creates synthetic trial data that follows regulatory standards—proper SDTM domains, MedDRA-coded adverse events, LOINC-coded labs, and realistic enrollment patterns across multi-site, multi-country trials.

Whether you need a small Phase 1 dose-escalation study or a large Phase 3 pivotal trial with SDTM/ADaM output, TrialSim generates data suitable for testing EDC systems, statistical programming, and regulatory submission workflows.

## Quick Start

**Simple:**
```
Generate a Phase 3 oncology trial with 200 subjects
Generate adverse events for an immunotherapy trial
```

**SDTM domains:**
```
Generate DM domain for 50 subjects as SDTM
Generate AE domain with MedDRA coding
```

**With output format:**
```
Generate a Phase II trial as SDTM datasets
Generate analysis-ready data as ADaM
```

See [hello-healthsim examples](../../hello-healthsim/examples/trialsim-examples.md) for detailed examples with expected outputs.

## Integration with Other Products

| Product | Integration | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **PatientSim** | Patient → Subject | Cancer patient enrolls in trial |
| **PopulationSim** | Geography → Feasibility | County data → Site selection, diversity |
| **NetworkSim** | Provider → Investigator | Site PI with credentials |
| **MemberSim** | Standard of care claims | SOC claims during trial |

## Data-Driven Planning (PopulationSim v2.0)

When planning trials, TrialSim uses **real population data** for evidence-based feasibility:

```
Identify top 5 US counties for a Phase III NASH trial based on patient availability
```

This provides:
- Disease prevalence from CDC PLACES for feasibility estimates
- Demographic distributions for diversity planning (FDA guidance compliance)
- SVI data for site access and enrollment projections
- Data provenance for audit trails

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md#cross-product-populationsim-integration) for full integration details.
