# Phase 3 Pivotal Trials

**Status**: Placeholder - Content to be developed

Phase 3 pivotal trials are confirmatory studies designed to provide substantial evidence of efficacy and safety for regulatory approval.

## Characteristics

| Aspect | Typical Values |
|--------|----------------|
| Sample Size | 300-3000+ subjects |
| Duration | 2-4 years |
| Sites | 50-200+ globally |
| Countries | 10-40 |
| Primary Endpoint | Usually 1-2 |
| Randomization | 1:1 or 2:1 (treatment:control) |

## Planned Content

### Study Design Patterns
- Parallel group
- Crossover (rare in Phase 3)
- Adaptive designs
- Master protocols (umbrella, basket, platform)

### Visit Schedule Patterns
- Screening visits
- Baseline assessments
- Treatment period visits
- Follow-up/safety visits
- Early termination visits

### Safety Data Patterns
- Adverse event incidence by SOC
- Laboratory abnormalities
- Vital sign patterns
- ECG findings

### Efficacy Data Patterns
- Primary endpoint responses
- Secondary endpoint patterns
- Subgroup analyses
- Time-to-event data

## Example Request

"Generate a Phase 3 pivotal trial for a diabetes drug with 500 subjects across 30 US sites"
