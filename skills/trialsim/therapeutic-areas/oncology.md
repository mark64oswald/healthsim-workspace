# Oncology Trials

Generate realistic oncology clinical trial data with RECIST 1.1 tumor response assessments, survival endpoints, and cancer-specific adverse event patterns.

---

## For Claude

This is a **therapeutic area skill** for generating oncology trial data. Apply this when users request cancer clinical trials. Combine with phase scenario skills for complete trial generation.

**Always apply this skill when you see:**
- References to oncology, cancer, or tumor trials
- RECIST, tumor response, or imaging assessments
- Survival endpoints (OS, PFS, DFS)
- Cancer drug classes (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy)
- Specific cancer types (NSCLC, breast, colorectal, melanoma)

## RECIST 1.1 Response Criteria

### Target Lesion Assessment

| Response | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| **Complete Response (CR)** | Disappearance of all target lesions |
| **Partial Response (PR)** | ≥30% decrease in sum of diameters |
| **Progressive Disease (PD)** | ≥20% increase AND ≥5mm absolute increase, or new lesion |
| **Stable Disease (SD)** | Neither PR nor PD criteria met |

### Overall Response

| Target | Non-Target | New Lesions | Overall Response |
|--------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| CR | CR | No | CR |
| CR | Non-CR/Non-PD | No | PR |
| PR | Any | No | PR |
| SD | Any | No | SD |
| Any | PD | Any | PD |
| Any | Any | Yes | PD |

## Common Oncology Endpoints

### Primary Endpoints by Setting

| Setting | Common Primary Endpoints |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Metastatic (1L) | Overall Survival (OS), PFS |
| Metastatic (2L+) | PFS, ORR |
| Adjuvant | Disease-Free Survival (DFS) |
| Neoadjuvant | Pathological Complete Response (pCR) |

### Secondary Endpoints

- **Duration of Response (DOR)** - Time from response to progression
- **Disease Control Rate (DCR)** - CR + PR + SD
- **Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)** - CR + PR + SD ≥6 months
- **Time to Response (TTR)** - Time from randomization to first response

## Cancer-Specific Patterns

### Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

**Biomarkers:**
- EGFR mutations (exon 19 del, L858R, T790M)
- ALK rearrangement
- ROS1 rearrangement
- KRAS G12C
- PD-L1 expression (TPS %, CPS)
- BRAF V600E

**Typical Response Rates:**
| Treatment | ORR | Median PFS | Median OS |
|-----------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Chemotherapy (1L) | 25-35% | 5-6 months | 10-12 months |
| IO monotherapy (PD-L1 ≥50%) | 40-50% | 7-10 months | 20-26 months |
| IO + Chemo | 45-60% | 8-9 months | 18-22 months |
| EGFR TKI (EGFR+) | 70-80% | 10-18 months | 24-38 months |

### Breast Cancer

**Biomarkers:**
- ER/PR status
- HER2 status (IHC, FISH)
- Ki-67
- BRCA1/2 mutations

**Subtypes:**
| Subtype | ER | PR | HER2 | Treatment Approach |
|---------|----|----|------|-------------------|
| Luminal A | + | + | - | Endocrine ± chemo |
| Luminal B | + | ± | - | Endocrine + chemo |
| HER2+ | ± | ± | + | Anti-HER2 + chemo |
| Triple Negative | - | - | - | Chemo ± IO |

### Melanoma

**Biomarkers:**
- BRAF V600E/K
- NRAS
- PD-L1

**Typical Response Rates:**
| Treatment | ORR | Median PFS |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| Anti-PD-1 monotherapy | 40-45% | 6-8 months |
| Anti-PD-1 + Anti-CTLA-4 | 55-60% | 11-12 months |
| BRAF + MEK (BRAF+) | 65-70% | 11-14 months |

## Adverse Events by Drug Class

### Chemotherapy

| AE Category | Common Events | Grade 3-4 Rate |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hematologic | Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia | 30-50% |
| GI | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea | 5-15% |
| Constitutional | Fatigue, alopecia | 5-10% |
| Neurologic | Peripheral neuropathy | 5-20% |

### Checkpoint Inhibitors

| AE Category | Common Events | Grade 3-4 Rate |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Endocrine | Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism | 1-2% |
| GI | Diarrhea, colitis | 2-5% |
| Hepatic | Hepatitis, elevated LFTs | 2-5% |
| Pulmonary | Pneumonitis | 2-5% |
| Skin | Rash, pruritus | 1-3% |
