# NetworkSim-Local

**Real Provider Data Integration for HealthSim**

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: This is an independent implementation from NetworkSim, exploring real NPPES data integration versus synthetic generation.

---

## Overview

NetworkSim-Local provides **actual provider, facility, and pharmacy data** from public CMS sources, enabling HealthSim to generate synthetic healthcare scenarios with real-world provider grounding.

| Aspect | NetworkSim (v1.0) | NetworkSim-Local |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Data source** | Claude generates | Real NPPES/CMS files |
| **NPI** | Synthetic (valid format) | Real NPIs from registry |
| **Addresses** | Plausible | Actual practice locations |
| **Specialties** | Correct codes | Real taxonomy assignments |
| **Storage** | None (on-demand) | Local DuckDB database |

---

## Data Sources

| Source | Description | Update Frequency |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **NPPES NPI Registry** | 8.6M+ provider records | Monthly |
| **CMS Provider of Services** | Hospital/facility characteristics | Quarterly |
| **NUCC Taxonomy Codes** | Specialty classification | Semi-annual |

1. **Data is LOCAL only** - Never commit NPPES/CMS data to git
2. **No PHI** - NPPES is public FOIA data, no patient information
3. **Independent from NetworkSim** - This is an experimental parallel implementation
4. **Update manually** - Download new NPPES monthly file as needed
