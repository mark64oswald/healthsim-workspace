# NetworkSim

## Overview

NetworkSim provides healthcare network knowledge and synthetic entity generation for the HealthSim ecosystem. Unlike other products that generate transaction data (encounters, claims, prescriptions), NetworkSim focuses on the structural elements that support those transactions:

1. **Reference Knowledge** - Network types, plan structures, pharmacy benefits, PBM operations
2. **Synthetic Generation** - Providers, facilities, pharmacies, network configurations
3. **Integration Patterns** - Cross-product enhancement for realistic data

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Network Type Reference

```
User: What's the difference between an HMO and a PPO?

Claude: [Routes to reference/network-types.md]

HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) and PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) 
differ primarily in flexibility and cost:

| Aspect | HMO | PPO |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Network | Must use in-network providers | Can use any provider |
| Referrals | Required for specialists | Not required |
| PCP Required | Yes | No |
| Out-of-Network | Not covered (except emergency) | Covered at higher cost |
| Premiums | Lower | Higher |
| Cost Sharing | Lower | Higher |

HMOs work best for people who want lower costs and don't mind the gatekeeper model.
PPOs suit those who value flexibility and are willing to pay more for it.
```

### Example 2: Generate a Provider

```
User: Generate a cardiologist in San Diego

Claude: [Routes to synthetic/synthetic-provider.md]

{
  "npi": "1234567890",
  "entity_type": "individual",
  "provider": {
    "last_name": "Martinez",
    "first_name": "Elena",
    "credential": "MD, FACC",
    "gender": "F"
  },
  "taxonomy": {
    "code": "207RC0000X",
    "classification": "Internal Medicine",
    "specialization": "Cardiovascular Disease",
    "display_name": "Cardiologist"
  },
  "practice_location": {

    "address_line_2": "Suite 300",

      "privileges": ["Admitting", "Surgical"]
    }
  ],
  "accepting_new_patients": true,
  "languages": ["English", "Spanish"]
}
```

### Example 3: Cross-Product Integration

```
User: Generate a provider for this heart failure patient's cardiology referral

Claude: [Routes to integration/provider-for-encounter.md]

Based on the patient's heart failure diagnosis (I50.9) and location in Harris County, TX,
I'll generate an appropriate cardiologist:

{
  "npi": "1987654321",
  "entity_type": "individual",
  "provider": {
    "last_name": "Patel",
    "first_name": "Vikram",
    "credential": "MD, FACC, FHFSA",
    "gender": "M"
  },
  "taxonomy": {
    "code": "207RC0001X",
    "classification": "Internal Medicine",
    "specialization": "Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology",
    "display_name": "Heart Failure Specialist"
  },
  "practice_location": {
    "city": "Houston",
    "state": "TX",
    "county_fips": "48201"
  },
  "integration_context": {
    "source_product": "patientsim",
    "matched_on": ["diagnosis_category", "geography"],
    "patient_diagnosis": "I50.9",
    "referral_reason": "Heart failure management"
  }
}
```

## Boundary Rules

Understanding what NetworkSim owns vs. what other products own:

### NetworkSim Owns

- Network type knowledge and definitions
- Provider/facility/pharmacy entity generation
- Network configuration patterns
- Benefit design concepts (structure, not pricing)
- PBM operational concepts

### Other Products Own

| Responsibility | Owner Product |
|----------------|---------------|
| Claim processing logic | MemberSim |
| Claim adjudication | MemberSim |
| Formulary drug coverage decisions | RxMemberSim |
| Drug-specific PA criteria | RxMemberSim |
| Encounter generation | PatientSim |
| Clinical documentation | PatientSim |
| Geographic/demographic data | PopulationSim |
| SDOH indicators | PopulationSim |

### Collaboration Pattern

When generating data that spans boundaries:

1. **NetworkSim** generates the structural entity (provider, facility, pharmacy)
2. **Other product** consumes that entity in its workflow
3. **Identity correlation** maintained via NPI, CCN, NCPDP identifiers

---

## Output Formats

NetworkSim entities can be output in multiple formats:

| Format | Use Case | Available For |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Canonical JSON | Default, cross-product integration | All entities |
| FHIR R4 | Interoperability | Providers, Facilities, Pharmacies |
| NPPES-style CSV | Bulk provider data | Providers |
| CMS POS-style | Facility reporting | Facilities |
| NCPDP-style | Pharmacy data exchange | Pharmacies |
