# NetworkSim Master Skill

## Overview

**NetworkSim** provides comprehensive healthcare provider network data including individual providers, facilities, pharmacies, and quality metrics. Built on real CMS National Provider Identifier (NPI) Registry data with 8.9M active US providers, Medicare Provider of Services data with 77K facilities, and CMS quality ratings.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Search providers by specialty, location, and credentials
- Find healthcare facilities with bed counts and quality ratings
- Locate pharmacies by type and geography
- Analyze provider density and network adequacy
- Cross-reference with population health data (PopulationSim)

**Data Sources**:
- **NPPES**: 8.9M providers (97.77% with county FIPS)
- **Provider of Services**: 77K facilities across all types
- **Hospital Compare**: 5.4K hospitals with CMS star ratings
- **Physician Compare**: 1.5M physicians with quality metrics
- **AHRF**: County-level healthcare resource data

## Trigger Phrases

NetworkSim activates when users request provider or network data:

- "Find [specialty] providers in [location]"
- "Search for hospitals near [ZIP code]"
- "Locate pharmacies in [county]"
- "Show me provider networks in [state]"
- "Analyze provider density in [region]"
- "Find facilities with [beds] beds"
- "Search for [quality rating]-star hospitals"

## Product Architecture

### Data Organization

NetworkSim data is stored in the `network` schema of `healthsim.duckdb`:

```
network/
├── providers          (8.9M records)  - Individual + organizational providers
├── facilities         (77K records)   - Hospitals, nursing homes, clinics
├── hospital_quality   (5.4K records)  - CMS Hospital Compare ratings
├── physician_quality  (1.5M records)  - CMS Physician Compare metrics
└── ahrf_county        (3K records)    - Area Health Resources Files
```

### Cross-Product Integration

NetworkSim integrates with other HealthSim products:

**PopulationSim**: Geographic JOIN via county_fips for demographic analysis
**PatientSim**: Assign providers to patient encounters by specialty/location
**MemberSim**: Build provider networks for health plan claims  
**RxMemberSim**: Link prescriptions to pharmacy locations
**TrialSim**: Identify trial sites and recruiting physicians

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Build Primary Care Network for Texas

```markdown
1. Find PCPs in target counties (provider-search)
2. Filter by quality metrics (physician-quality-search)
3. Generate network roster (network-roster)
4. Analyze coverage adequacy (coverage-analysis)
5. Export to standard format (network-export)
```

### Workflow 2: Identify Healthcare Deserts

```markdown
1. Calculate provider density by county (provider-density)
2. Cross-reference with diabetes prevalence (PopulationSim)
3. Identify high-need, low-access areas (healthcare-deserts)
4. Find nearest facilities (facility-search)
5. Generate gap analysis report
```

### Workflow 3: Pharmacy Network Development

```markdown
1. Find retail pharmacies by geography (pharmacy-search)
2. Analyze pharmacy density (provider-density)
3. Identify specialty pharmacy capabilities
4. Build network roster (network-roster)
5. Integrate with prescription data (RxMemberSim)
```

## Data Quality

### Geographic Coverage
- **97.77% county FIPS coverage** for providers (8.7M of 8.9M)
- Missing FIPS primarily: military addresses (APO/FPO), PO Box-only
- **3,213 counties covered** (100% of PopulationSim + 70 additional)

### Provider Data Quality
- **NPI format**: 100% valid (10 digits)
- **Entity types**: 85% Individual (Type 1), 15% Organization (Type 2)
- **Taxonomy codes**: 99%+ have primary taxonomy (taxonomy_1)
- **No duplicate NPIs**: Verified via automated testing

### Facility Data Quality
- **77,302 facilities** across all types
- **7% have quality ratings** (hospitals only)
- **Bed counts**: Available for hospitals and nursing homes
- **Missing county_fips**: Facility table needs geographic enrichment

### Known Limitations
- Gender field not populated in current data
- Some specialty taxonomies incomplete
- Facilities lack direct county FIPS (use city/state or provider linkage)

## Performance Benchmarks

All benchmarks measured on MacBook Pro with 1.65 GB database:

| Query Type | Avg Time | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Provider count | <100ms | Simple filters |
| Geographic + specialty | 200-500ms | With county JOIN |
| Cross-product analytics | 500ms-1s | Population + network |
| Pharmacy density | 20-50ms | Taxonomy filter |
| Facility quality JOIN | 200-400ms | Hospital Compare |
| Full test suite (12 tests) | <200ms | Average 13.8ms/test |

**Optimization Tips**:
- Filter by taxonomy_1 early for specialty searches
- Use county_fips instead of city names
- Add entity_type_code to WHERE clause
- LIMIT results appropriately
