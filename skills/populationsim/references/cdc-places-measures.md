- `[MEASURE]_CrudePrev`: Crude prevalence percentage (e.g., `DIABETES_CrudePrev`)
- `[MEASURE]_AdjPrev`: Age-adjusted prevalence percentage
- `[MEASURE]_Crude95CI`: 95% confidence interval for crude estimate
- `[MEASURE]_Adj95CI`: 95% confidence interval for adjusted estimate

### Key Geography Columns
- `StateAbbr`: State abbreviation (e.g., "TX")
- `CountyName`: County name
- `CountyFIPS`: 5-digit county FIPS code
- `LocationID`: 11-digit tract FIPS (tract file only)
