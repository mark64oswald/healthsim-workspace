# Health Behavior Patterns Skill

## Overview

The health-behavior-patterns skill analyzes modifiable health risk behaviors across geographic areas using CDC PLACES data. This enables understanding of lifestyle factors that drive chronic disease burden and informs prevention opportunities.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Risk factor assessment for population health
- Prevention program targeting
- Understanding disease drivers
- Behavioral health intervention planning
- Cohort SDOH profile development

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "Compare obesity rates between [A] and [B]"
- "Physical activity patterns in [region]"
- "Health behaviors for [geography]"
- "Risk factor profile for [area]"
- "Which counties have highest [behavior]?"

**Request**: "Analyze smoking patterns in Kentucky"

**Response**:

**Kentucky Smoking Analysis**

**Current Smoking Rate**: 22.4% (vs 14.1% national) ⚠️ Highest in US

**Trend**: Decreasing (-4.2% since 2015, but still 58% above national)

**County Variation**:
| Category | Rate Range | Counties |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Highest | 28-32% | Owsley, McCreary, Clay |
| Moderate | 20-24% | Most rural counties |
| Lowest | 12-16% | Fayette, Oldham, Boone |

**Demographic Patterns**:
| Group | Smoking Rate |
|-------|--------------|
| No HS Diploma | 38.2% |
| HS Graduate | 28.4% |
| Some College | 22.1% |
| Bachelor's+ | 9.8% |

**Health Impact**:
| Condition | KY Rate | National | Excess |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| COPD | 10.8% | 6.2% | +74% |
| Lung Cancer Mortality | 72/100K | 38/100K | +89% |
| CHD | 7.4% | 5.4% | +37% |

**Prevention Implications**:
- Priority target: Low-education populations
- Geographic focus: Eastern Kentucky
- Intervention: Tobacco cessation + economic support

| State | Obesity | Physical Inactivity |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Mississippi | 39.8% | 32.4% |
| West Virginia | 38.2% | 30.8% |
| Arkansas | 37.4% | 29.2% |
| Louisiana | 36.8% | 28.4% |

*Western States (lowest to highest)*:
| State | Obesity | Physical Inactivity |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| Colorado | 23.8% | 16.8% |
| Hawaii | 24.2% | 18.4% |
| California | 25.8% | 17.4% |
| Utah | 26.4% | 18.2% |
| Montana | 27.4% | 20.2% |

**Key Correlations**:
- Obesity ↔ Physical Inactivity: r = 0.82
- Obesity ↔ Poverty Rate: r = 0.64
- Obesity ↔ Education: r = -0.58
