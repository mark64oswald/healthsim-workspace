# Enrollment Projection Skill

## Overview

The enrollment-projection skill models clinical trial enrollment timelines by combining eligible population estimates, site network characteristics, and historical recruitment rates. It accounts for site ramp-up, seasonal variations, and competitive landscape effects.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Project enrollment timelines
- Optimize site count decisions
- Identify enrollment risks
- Support protocol timeline planning
- Model scenario variations

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "How long to enroll [N] subjects?"
- "Enrollment projection for [trial]"
- "Recruitment timeline for [protocol]"
- "Project enrollment with [X] sites"
- "What enrollment rate can we expect?"

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `target_enrollment` | int | Yes | - | Total subjects needed |
| `num_sites` | int | Yes | - | Number of sites |
| `indication` | string | Yes | - | Target condition |
| `eligible_per_site` | int | No | calculated | Eligible population per site catchment |
| `screen_to_enroll` | float | No | 0.35 | Screen-to-randomize ratio |
| `site_activation_schedule` | object | No | standard | Site ramp-up pattern |
| `competition_factor` | float | No | 1.0 | Competitive adjustment |

---

## Data Sources (Embedded v2.0)

Enrollment projections use SVI data for SDOH-adjusted retention modeling:

| Data Source | File | Application |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| CDC SVI (County) | `data/county/svi_county_2022.csv` | Access barriers, retention risk |
| CDC SVI (Tract) | `data/tract/svi_tract_2022.csv` | Granular SDOH for site-level adjustment |
| ADI (Block Group) | `data/block_group/adi_blockgroup_2023.csv` | Deprivation-based dropout risk |
| CDC PLACES (County) | `data/county/places_county_2024.csv` | Uninsured rate, access to care |

### SDOH-Adjusted Retention Model

```python
# Base retention rate
base_retention = 0.85

# Look up site catchment SVI
site_svi = lookup(svi_county, site.county_fips, 'RPL_THEMES')
uninsured = lookup(svi_county, site.county_fips, 'EP_UNINSUR')

# Apply SDOH adjustments
if site_svi > 0.75:  # High vulnerability
    retention_modifier = 0.90  # 10% higher dropout
elif site_svi > 0.50:  # Moderate
    retention_modifier = 0.95
else:
    retention_modifier = 1.0

adjusted_retention = base_retention * retention_modifier
```

### Provenance in Projections

```json
{
  "enrollment_projection": {
    "months_to_target": 14,
    "retention_rate": 0.81,
    "sdoh_adjustment": {
      "source": "CDC_SVI_2022",
      "mean_svi": 0.62,
      "retention_modifier": 0.95,
      "file": "populationsim/data/county/svi_county_2022.csv"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Enrollment Model Components

### Baseline Enrollment Rate

```
Monthly Enrollment = Sites_Active × Screens_per_Site × Screen_to_Enroll

Where:
- Screens_per_Site = f(Eligible_Population, Awareness, Motivation)
- Typical range: 2-8 screens/site/month
```

### Site Activation Curve

| Month | Sites Active (Standard) | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------|-------|
| 1 | 25% | Early activators |
| 2 | 60% | Main wave |
| 3 | 85% | Late activators |
| 4 | 95% | Stragglers |
| 5+ | 100% | Full network |

### Seasonal Adjustments

| Season | Factor | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Jan-Feb | 0.90 | Post-holiday slowdown |
| Mar-May | 1.05 | Spring uptick |
| Jun-Aug | 0.85 | Summer vacations |
| Sep-Nov | 1.10 | Fall peak |
| Dec | 0.80 | Holiday slowdown |

### Competition Impact

| Competition Level | Factor | Definition |
|-------------------|--------|------------|
| None | 1.0 | No competing trials |
| Low | 0.95 | 1-3 competing trials |
| Moderate | 0.85 | 4-8 competing trials |
| High | 0.70 | 9+ competing trials |
| Saturated | 0.50 | Major indication, many trials |

### Example 2: Rare Disease Timeline

**Request**: "How long to enroll 300 NASH F3 patients with 25 sites?"

**Response**:

**NASH F3 Enrollment Projection**

**Challenge Factors**:
- Low diagnosis rate (20% of true prevalent)
- Specialist-dependent identification
- High screen fail rate (50-60%)
- Moderate competition

**Projection Parameters**:
| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Target | 300 | |
| Sites | 25 | Hepatology centers |
| Eligible/site | 800 | Diagnosed F3 patients |
| Screens/site/mo | 2.5 | Lower than common diseases |
| Screen-to-enroll | 40% | F3 confirmation required |

**Projected Timeline**: 14 months

**Monthly Progression**:
| Month | Sites | Enrolled | Cumulative |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1-2 | 8-15 | 8-15 | 23 |
| 3-4 | 22-25 | 20-22 | 65 |
| 5-6 | 25 | 22-24 | 111 |
| 7-8 | 25 | 22-24 | 157 |
| 9-10 | 25 | 22-24 | 203 |
| 11-12 | 25 | 22-24 | 249 |
| 13-14 | 25 | 22-24 | 300 |

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Activate 5 additional sites at Month 6 if behind
- Consider imaging screening protocol
- Partner with bariatric surgery programs

### Example 3: Accelerated Enrollment

**Request**: "Fastest way to enroll 500 hypertension patients"

**Response**:

**Accelerated Hypertension Enrollment**

**Advantages**:
- Very high prevalence (48% of adults)
- Simple inclusion criteria possible
- High diagnosis/awareness rate
- Extensive research infrastructure

**Aggressive Scenario**:
| Parameter | Standard | Accelerated |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Sites | 20 | 40 |
| Screens/site/mo | 8 | 12 |
| Screen-to-enroll | 45% | 50% |
| Timeline | 6 months | 3 months |

**Accelerated Monthly Projection**:
| Month | Sites | Enrolled | Cumulative |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | 25 | 120 | 120 |
| 2 | 38 | 190 | 310 |
| 3 | 40 | 200 | 510 ✓ |

**Requirements for Acceleration**:
- Pre-qualified sites ready to activate
- Simplified protocol (minimal exclusions)
- Competitive compensation
- Strong site relationships
- Flexible monitoring approach

**Cost Tradeoff**: 
- ~40% higher site costs
- Faster database lock
- Earlier NDA submission
