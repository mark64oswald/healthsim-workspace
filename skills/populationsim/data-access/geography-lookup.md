# Geography Lookup Skill

## Overview

The geography-lookup skill resolves geographic identifiers using PopulationSim's crosswalk reference data. Use this when you need to:
- Convert county names to FIPS codes (and vice versa)
- Identify which county a tract belongs to
- List counties in a metropolitan area (CBSA)
- Validate geographic codes

## Trigger Phrases

- "What's the FIPS code for [county], [state]?"
- "Which state is FIPS [code]?"
- "What county is tract [FIPS] in?"
- "List counties in the [metro area] MSA"
- "What's the CBSA code for [metro]?"
- "Is [FIPS] a valid county code?"
- "Which counties are in CBSA [code]?"

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| lookup_type | string | Yes | "state", "county", "tract", or "cbsa" |
| input | string | Yes | Name or FIPS code to look up |
| state | string | Conditional | Required for ambiguous county names |

## Crosswalk Files

### State FIPS Codes
**File:** `population.svi_county` (state lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
**Columns:** state_fips, state_name, state_abbr
**Records:** 51 (50 states + DC)

### County FIPS Codes
**File:** `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
**Columns:** state_fips, state_abbr, county_fips, county_name
**Records:** 3,144

### Tract to County Mapping
**File:** tract-to-county mapping (via healthsim_query)
**Columns:** tract_fips, county_fips, state_abbr, county_name, tract_name
**Records:** 84,120

### CBSA Definitions
**File:** CBSA crosswalk (via healthsim_query)
**Columns:** county_fips, cbsa_code, cbsa_title, cbsa_type, csa_code, csa_title, central_outlying
**Records:** 1,918 county-CBSA mappings (937 unique CBSAs)

## FIPS Code Structure

### State FIPS (2 digits)
```
06 = California
48 = Texas
17 = Illinois
```

### County FIPS (5 digits)
```
State (2) + County (3)
48201 = Harris County, TX (48 = TX, 201 = Harris)
06073 = San Diego County, CA (06 = CA, 073 = San Diego)
17031 = Cook County, IL (17 = IL, 031 = Cook)
```

### Tract FIPS (11 digits)
```
State (2) + County (3) + Tract (6)
48201311500 = Tract 3115 in Harris County, TX
06073008300 = Tract 83 in San Diego County, CA
```

### Block Group FIPS (12 digits)
```
State (2) + County (3) + Tract (6) + Block Group (1)
482012104001 = Block Group 1, Tract 2104, Harris County, TX
```

## Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: County Name to FIPS

**Input:** "What's the FIPS for Harris County, Texas?"

**Process:**
1. Read `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
2. Filter: county_name = "Harris" AND state_abbr = "TX"
3. Return county_fips

**Response:**
Harris County, Texas has FIPS code **48201**.

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| State FIPS | 48 |
| County Code | 201 |
| Full FIPS | 48201 |

---

### Pattern 2: FIPS to County Name

**Input:** "Which county is 06073?"

**Process:**
1. Read `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
2. Filter: county_fips = "06073"
3. Return county_name, state_abbr

**Response:**
FIPS 06073 is **San Diego County, California**.

---

### Pattern 3: Tract to County

**Input:** "What county is census tract 48201311500 in?"

**Process:**
1. Extract county FIPS from tract (first 5 digits): 48201
2. Read `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
3. Look up county name

**Response:**
Census tract 48201311500 is in **Harris County, Texas** (county FIPS 48201).

The tract portion is 311500, which is tract 3115.00.

### Pattern 4: CBSA Lookup

**Input:** "List the counties in the Houston MSA"

**Process:**
1. Read CBSA crosswalk (via healthsim_query)
2. Filter: cbsa_title contains "Houston"
3. Return all matching counties

**Response:**
**Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX MSA** (CBSA 26420)

| County | FIPS | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| Harris | 48201 | Central |
| Fort Bend | 48157 | Central |

### Pattern 5: Ambiguous County Resolution

**Input:** "What's the FIPS for Washington County?"

**Process:**
1. Read `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
2. Filter: county_name = "Washington"
3. Find multiple matches → request clarification

**Response:**
"Washington County" exists in **30 states**. Please specify the state.

Common ones include:
- Washington County, PA (42125)
- Washington County, OR (41067)

### Pattern 6: State FIPS Lookup

**Input:** "What state is FIPS 48?"

**Process:**
1. Read `population.svi_county` (state lookup via healthsim_query_reference)
2. Filter: state_fips = "48"
3. Return state_name, state_abbr

**Response:**
State FIPS 48 is **Texas (TX)**.

## Validation Rules

### FIPS Validation
- State FIPS: 2 digits, 01-56 (with gaps)
- County FIPS: 5 digits, valid state prefix
- Tract FIPS: 11 digits, valid county prefix
- Block Group FIPS: 12 digits, valid tract prefix

### Name Matching
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handle common variations ("St." vs "Saint")
- Require state for ambiguous county names

### Error Handling
- Invalid FIPS: "FIPS code [X] is not valid. Check the format."
- Not found: "No geography found matching [X]."
- Ambiguous: List all matches, request clarification
