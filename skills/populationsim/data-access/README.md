# Data Access Skills

## Overview

PopulationSim v2.0 includes an **embedded data package** (148 MB) with real demographic, health, and SDOH data covering 100% of US geography. These skills provide direct access patterns for reading and aggregating this data.

**Key Principle**: Every response that includes data from these files must cite the source and vintage.

## Data Package Summary

| Level | Files | Records | Key Data |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| County | 2 | ~3,144 | CDC PLACES health measures, SVI rankings |
| Tract | 2 | ~84,000 | CDC PLACES health measures, SVI full dataset |
| Block Group | 1 | ~242,000 | ADI national/state rankings |
| Crosswalks | 4 | Various | FIPS codes, CBSA definitions |

## Skills in This Category

| Skill | Purpose | Key Triggers |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| [data-lookup.md](data-lookup.md) | Look up specific values by geography | "what is the diabetes rate", "look up SVI" |
| [geography-lookup.md](geography-lookup.md) | Resolve FIPS codes, find geographies | "FIPS for", "which county", "what state" |
| [data-aggregation.md](data-aggregation.md) | Aggregate across geographic levels | "aggregate tracts", "metro area totals" |

## Data File Locations

All data is in MotherDuck via the healthsim_query_reference MCP tool:

```

## Data Provenance Principle

**Every data value returned must include its source.** Standard format:

```
Harris County, TX has a diabetes prevalence of **13.2%** among adults.

*Source: CDC PLACES 2024 Release (2022 BRFSS data)*
```

For JSON output:
```json
{
  "value": 13.2,
  "unit": "percent",
  "source": "CDC PLACES 2024",
  "data_year": "2022 BRFSS",
  "geography": {
    "type": "county",
    "fips": "48201",
    "name": "Harris County, TX"
  },
  "measure": "DIABETES_CrudePrev"
}
```
