# Data Lookup Skill

## Overview

The data-lookup skill provides direct access to PopulationSim's reference data (via MCP). Use this skill when you need exact values for specific geographies rather than synthesized estimates.

**Data-First Philosophy**: When data exists in the reference data, return the exact value with source citation. Only synthesize when data is unavailable.

## Trigger Phrases

- "What is the [measure] in [geography]?"
- "Look up [measure] for [geography]"
- "What's the exact [measure] rate in [county/tract]?"
- "Show me CDC PLACES data for [geography]"
- "Get the SVI for [geography]"
- "Find the ADI for [block group]"
- "What does the data say about [geography]?"

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| geography_type | string | Yes | "county", "tract", or "block_group" |
| geography_id | string | Yes | FIPS code or name (e.g., "48201" or "Harris County, TX") |
| dataset | string | No | "places", "svi", or "adi" (auto-detected from measure) |
| measures | array | No | Specific measures to return (default: key measures) |

## Generation Patterns

### Pattern 1: County Health Indicator Lookup

**Input:** "What is the diabetes prevalence in Harris County, TX?"

**Process:**
1. Identify geography: county = "Harris", state = "TX"
2. Resolve FIPS: Look up in `population.svi_county` (FIPS lookup via healthsim_query_reference) → 48201
3. Read `population.places_county` (via healthsim_query_reference)
4. Filter: CountyFIPS = "48201"
5. Extract: DIABETES_CrudePrev
6. Format response with provenance

**Response:**
Harris County, TX has a diabetes prevalence of **13.2%** among adults.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Crude Prevalence | 13.2% |
| Geography | Harris County, TX (FIPS 48201) |
| Population | 4,835,125 |
| Source | CDC PLACES 2024 Release |
| Data Year | 2022 BRFSS |

This is higher than the national average of 10.1%.
