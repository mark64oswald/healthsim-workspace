# PopulationSim Developer Guide

## Overview

PopulationSim generates synthetic population demographics, health indicators, and social determinants of health (SDOH) for geographic areas. It serves as the foundational data layer for the HealthSim ecosystem.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Population Profile

```
User: Create a population profile for Harris County, Texas

Claude: I'll generate a comprehensive population profile for Harris County (FIPS 48201).

[Returns PopulationProfile with demographics, health indicators, SDOH]
```

### 2. SDOH-Focused Analysis

```
User: Analyze social vulnerability in census tracts around downtown Houston

Claude: I'll analyze SVI themes for tracts in the downtown Houston area.

[Returns tract-level SVI analysis with theme breakdowns]
```

### 3. Cohort Definition

```
User: Define a cohort of diabetic adults aged 40-70 in high-vulnerability areas

Claude: I'll create a CohortSpecification targeting diabetic patients in 
high-SDOH census tracts.

[Returns CohortSpecification with clinical and SDOH requirements]
```

## Core Concepts

### Geographic Hierarchy

PopulationSim works at multiple geographic levels:

| Level | FIPS Digits | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| State | 2 | State-level analysis |
| County | 5 | Primary analysis unit |
| Census Tract | 11 | Fine-grained SDOH |
| Block Group | 12 | Most granular (ADI) |
| MSA/CBSA | 5 | Metropolitan areas |

### Data Sources

PopulationSim synthesizes data from:

| Source | Data Type | Update Frequency |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Census ACS 5-Year | Demographics | Annual |
| CDC PLACES | Health indicators | Annual |
| CDC/ATSDR SVI | Social vulnerability | Biennial |
| UW Neighborhood Atlas ADI | Area deprivation | Annual |
| USDA Food Access | Food deserts | Periodic |

### Key Models

1. **PopulationProfile** - Complete area snapshot
2. **CohortSpecification** - Population subsetting criteria
3. **GeographicEntity** - Location identification
4. **SDOHProfile** - Social determinants detail

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: County Health Profile

```
Step 1: Request population profile
User: Create a population profile for Dallas County, Texas

Step 2: Review demographics
- Age distribution
- Race/ethnicity composition
- Household structure

Step 3: Examine health indicators
- Chronic condition prevalence
- Health behaviors
- Prevention rates

Step 4: Assess SDOH
- SVI overall and themes
- ADI percentiles
- Z-code prevalence estimates
```

### Workflow 2: High-SDOH Cohort for PatientSim

```
Step 1: Define geography
User: I need patients from high-vulnerability areas of Houston

Step 2: Set SDOH requirements
- SVI ≥ 0.70
- ADI percentile ≥ 70
- Transportation insecurity flag

Step 3: Add clinical criteria
- Age 30-65
- Include diabetes, hypertension
- Exclude pregnancy

Step 4: Generate cohort
- Target size: 1,000
- Enable PatientSim integration
- Include Z-code assignment
```

### Workflow 3: Trial Feasibility Assessment

```
Step 1: Define protocol criteria
User: Assess feasibility for a diabetes trial at three Texas sites

Step 2: Analyze catchment areas
- Houston (48201)
- Dallas (48113)
- San Antonio (48029)

Step 3: Calculate eligible populations
- Age/condition filters
- Exclusion criteria impact

Step 4: Project diversity achievement
- Race/ethnicity targets
- SDOH diversity goals

Step 5: Model retention
- SDOH-adjusted retention rates
- Recommended accommodations
```

- Risk adjustment factors

### To TrialSim

PopulationSim provides:
- Eligible population estimates
- Diversity profiles
- Retention risk factors

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Focus

Begin with county-level profiles, then drill into tracts for SDOH detail.

### 2. Use Appropriate Geography

- County: General analysis, insurance modeling
- Tract: SDOH analysis, vulnerability assessment
- Block group: Fine-grained ADI analysis

### 3. Validate Against Real Data

PopulationSim generates realistic estimates. For production use, validate against actual ACS/PLACES data.

### 4. Consider Temporal Aspects

- ACS 5-year estimates smooth annual fluctuations
- CDC PLACES data has 2-year lag
- SVI updates biennially

### 5. Document Assumptions

When creating cohorts, document:
- Geographic scope
- SDOH thresholds
- Clinical criteria rationale

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No data for this geography"

- Verify FIPS code format (state=2, county=5, tract=11)
- Check if area exists in reference data
- Some rural areas have limited PLACES coverage

### "SDOH rates seem too high/low"

- Verify SVI/ADI thresholds are in valid ranges
- Check if using tract vs. county-level data
- Review Z-code calculation methodology

### "Cohort too small/large"

- Adjust clinical criteria stringency
- Modify SDOH thresholds
- Expand/contract geographic scope
