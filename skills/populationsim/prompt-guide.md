## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be Specific About Geography

✅ "Harris County, Texas (FIPS 48201)"  
❌ "Houston area"

### Specify Output Needs

✅ "Include Z-code prevalence estimates"  
❌ "Include SDOH data"

### Set Clear Thresholds

✅ "SVI ≥ 0.70, ADI national percentile ≥ 70"  
❌ "High vulnerability areas"

### Define Cohort Size

✅ "Target 1,000 patients with ±5% tolerance"  
❌ "A reasonably sized cohort"

### Clarify Integration Needs

✅ "Enable PatientSim integration with FHIR R4 output"  
❌ "Make it work with other tools"
