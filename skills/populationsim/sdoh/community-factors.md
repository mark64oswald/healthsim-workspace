# Community Factors Skill

## Overview

The community-factors skill analyzes neighborhood and community-level factors that influence health, including housing conditions, transportation access, food environment, and environmental quality. These structural factors create the context in which health behaviors and outcomes occur.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Housing quality and stability assessment
- Transportation barrier identification
- Food access/desert analysis
- Environmental health assessment
- Neighborhood effect quantification

---

## Trigger Phrases

- "Food deserts in [geography]"
- "Transportation access in [area]"
- "Housing conditions in [geography]"
- "Community health factors for [area]"
- "Environmental health in [region]"
- "Neighborhood factors affecting health"

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `geography` | string | Yes | - | County, tract, or metro |
| `focus` | string | No | "all" | "housing", "transportation", "food", "environment" |
| `compare_to` | string | No | - | Geography for comparison |

## Data Sources (Embedded v2.0)

Community factor data comes from embedded SVI and CDC PLACES files:

| Category | File | Key Columns |

| **Housing** | | |
| Multi-unit structures | `population.svi_tract` (via healthsim_query_reference) | E_MUNIT, EP_MUNIT |
| Mobile homes | `population.svi_tract` (via healthsim_query_reference) | E_MOBILE, EP_MOBILE |
| Crowding | `population.svi_tract` (via healthsim_query_reference) | E_CROWD, EP_CROWD |
| Housing cost burden | `population.svi_tract` (via healthsim_query_reference) | E_HBURD, EP_HBURD |
| **Transportation** | | |
| No vehicle | `population.svi_tract` (via healthsim_query_reference) | E_NOVEH, EP_NOVEH |
| Lack of transportation | `population.places_county` (via healthsim_query_reference) | LACKTRPT_CrudePrev |
| **Social Needs** | | |
| Food insecurity | `population.places_county` (via healthsim_query_reference) | FOODINSECU_CrudePrev |
| Housing insecurity | `population.places_county` (via healthsim_query_reference) | HOUSINSECU_CrudePrev |
| Utility shutoff threat | `population.places_county` (via healthsim_query_reference) | SHUTUTILITY_CrudePrev |

### Data Lookup Pattern

```
1. Identify geography type and FIPS code
2. Read SVI tract file for housing/transportation indicators
3. Read PLACES county file for social needs measures
4. Combine into community factor profile
5. Return with source citations
```
