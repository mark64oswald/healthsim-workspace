## PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

Before implementing anything, read these files to establish context:

### Required Reading (Execute These First)

```
1. Read: docs/networksim/NETWORKSIM-PROJECT-PLAN.md
   Focus: Sections 1-5 (Executive Summary through Implementation Phases)
   
2. Read: docs/networksim/NETWORKSIM-ARCHITECTURE-CONSISTENCY.md
   Focus: Directory structure, what NOT to create
   
3. Read: docs/networksim/NETWORKSIM-DOCUMENTATION-PLAN.md
   Focus: Section 2 (Documentation Deliverables)
   
4. Read: skills/populationsim/developer-guide.md
   Focus: Structure and quality as template to match
   
5. Read: skills/populationsim/prompt-guide.md
   Focus: Structure and example organization
