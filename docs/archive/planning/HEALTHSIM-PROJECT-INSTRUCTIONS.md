# HealthSim Claude Project Instructions

*Condensed guardrails for consistent development. Full details in docs/HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md and docs/HEALTHSIM-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md*

---

## Core Philosophy

**Conversation-First**: HealthSim generates synthetic healthcare data via natural language + Skills. No Python libraries or APIs - Skills contain domain knowledge, Claude generates data dynamically.

**Design → Super-Prompt → Implement**: Design thoroughly in Claude Desktop, create comprehensive super-prompts, execute systematically in Claude Code.

---

## Session Protocol (MANDATORY)

### Starting Every Session

1. **Read `CURRENT-WORK.md` FIRST** - This file tracks live state across sessions
2. **Verify git state** matches documented state:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/markoswald/Developer/projects/healthsim-workspace
   git log --oneline -3
   ```
3. **Confirm which phase/task is next** from the "Next Session Should" section
4. **If recovering from interruption**: Run tests first to verify clean state

### During a Session

- **Commit frequently** - After each major file group, not at the very end
- **If context feels heavy** - Commit current work, update CURRENT-WORK.md, suggest continuing in new session
- **Verify as you go** - Don't batch all verification to the end

### Ending Every Session

1. **Run tests**: `cd packages/core && pytest tests/ -v`
2. **Commit all changes** with descriptive message
3. **Update `CURRENT-WORK.md`** with:
   - What was completed (with commit hash)
   - What's next
   - Any important notes for next session
4. **Push to remote**: `git push`

### Multi-Session Initiatives

For large initiatives (like NetworkSim), create atomic session prompts:

```
docs/initiatives/{initiative-name}/
  MASTER-PLAN.md              # High-level roadmap (stable)
  SESSION-01-description.md   # One session's work
  SESSION-02-description.md   # One session's work
  ...
```

Each session prompt should:
- Fit comfortably in context (avoid 2000+ line monoliths)
- Have ONE clear deliverable
- End with verification steps and "update CURRENT-WORK.md"

## Repository Structure

**Single Repository**: `healthsim-workspace` (https://github.com/mark64oswald/healthsim-workspace)

```

## Architecture Rules

### Skills Organization

| Location | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `skills/{product}/` | Scenario and domain skills (flat structure) |
| `skills/{product}/{subcategory}/` | Allowed for logical groupings (oncology/, pediatrics/) |
| `formats/` | ALL output formats (shared, not product-specific) |
| `references/` | ALL reference data (shared, not product-specific) |

### DO NOT Create These Subdirectories

- `skills/{product}/scenarios/` - Put scenarios directly in product folder
- `skills/{product}/domain/` - Put domain files directly in product folder
- `skills/{product}/formats/` - Use root `formats/` instead
- `skills/{product}/models/` - Schemas defined inline in skills

### Skills Must Have

- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` (include trigger phrases)
- Sections: Overview, Trigger Phrases, Parameters table, Generation Patterns, Examples (≥2), Validation Rules, Related Skills

### Data Models

- Generate canonical JSON first, then transform to output format
- Extend common entities (Person → Patient → Member → Subject)
- Use standard code systems: ICD-10, CPT, LOINC, NDC, NPI, CDISC

### MCP = I/O Only

File system, database, GitHub operations. Generation happens in conversation.

## Products

| Product | Domain | Standards | Skills Location | Package Location |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| PatientSim | Clinical/EMR | FHIR, HL7v2, C-CDA | `skills/patientsim/` | `packages/patientsim/` |
| MemberSim | Payer/Claims | X12 837/835/834 | `skills/membersim/` | `packages/membersim/` |
| RxMemberSim | Pharmacy/PBM | NCPDP D.0 | `skills/rxmembersim/` | `packages/rxmembersim/` |
| TrialSim | Clinical Trials | CDISC SDTM/ADaM | `skills/trialsim/` | - |
| PopulationSim | Demographics/SDOH | Census, ACS | `skills/populationsim/` | - |
| NetworkSim | Provider Networks | NPPES, NPI | `skills/networksim/` | - |

## Development Workflow

### Every Super-Prompt Must Include

1. Context + reference documents to read
2. Pre-flight checklist
3. Specific deliverables (files to create/modify)
4. Step-by-step implementation with verification
5. Post-flight checklist
6. Success criteria

### After Every Implementation Session

- [ ] Test with sample generation request
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Verify documentation links
- [ ] Git add → commit (descriptive message) → push

### Commit Message Format

```
[Product] Brief description

Examples:
[TrialSim] Add Phase 3 pivotal trial skill
[MemberSim] Fix accumulator calculation example
[Docs] Clarify directory structure
```

## Link Patterns

From within `skills/{product}/`:

| Target | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| Same folder | `[file.md](file.md)` |
| Subcategory | `[category/file.md](category/file.md)` |
| Root formats | `[../../formats/fhir-r4.md](../../formats/fhir-r4.md)` |
| Root references | `[../../references/code-systems.md](../../references/code-systems.md)` |
| Hello examples | `[../../hello-healthsim/examples/quickstart.md](../../hello-healthsim/examples/quickstart.md)` |

---

## Key Reminders

- **FIRST: Read CURRENT-WORK.md** - Always check state before starting work
- **LAST: Update CURRENT-WORK.md** - Always update state before ending session
- **Single repo**: Clone `healthsim-workspace` to get everything
- **Follow existing patterns**: Review similar files before creating new ones
- **Cross-product integration**: Check for related skills in other products, add bidirectional references
- **Skills are flat**: Scenarios go directly in product folder, not nested
- **Formats are shared**: All formats in root `formats/`, never in product folders
- **Packages for Python**: Python infrastructure in `packages/`, not in `skills/`
- **Progressive disclosure**: Master skill routes to detailed skills
- **Extend, don't duplicate**: Reference canonical models
- **Commit frequently**: Don't batch all commits to session end
- **Test frequently**: Verify after each change
- **Document as you go**: CHANGELOG.md every session
