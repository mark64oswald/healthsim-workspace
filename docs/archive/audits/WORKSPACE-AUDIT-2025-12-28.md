# HealthSim Workspace Comprehensive Audit

**Date**: December 28, 2025  
**Auditor**: Claude (AI Assistant)  
**Scope**: Full workspace evaluation including Git hygiene, documentation, structure, and quality

---

## Executive Summary

The HealthSim workspace is well-organized with comprehensive documentation and consistent patterns across all six products. However, there is one **CRITICAL** issue requiring immediate attention: **Git LFS is not installed**, causing the 1.7 GB database to bloat the repository to 9.7 GB.

### Priority Actions

| Priority | Issue | Impact | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Git LFS not installed | 9.7 GB .git directory, slow clones | Medium |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Stale documentation files | Confusion, outdated info | Low |
| 🟢 LOW | Root-level session files | Clutter | Low |

---

## 1. Git Configuration Audit

### 1.1 Git LFS Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Finding**: Git LFS is configured in `.gitattributes` but **NOT INSTALLED** on the system.

```
$ git lfs version
Git LFS not installed
```

**Impact**:
- `.git` directory: **9.7 GB** (should be ~200 MB with LFS)
- `healthsim.duckdb`: **1.7 GB** stored directly in Git history
- Clone time: Significantly slower than necessary
- GitHub bandwidth: Excessive for collaborators

**Current .gitattributes** (correct configuration, just needs LFS installed):
```
*.duckdb filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
*.duckdb.wal filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
```

**Remediation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Install Git LFS
brew install git-lfs

# 2. Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install

# 3. Verify tracking
git lfs ls-files

# 4. (Optional) Clean history - requires force push
# WARNING: This rewrites history and requires coordination
git lfs migrate import --include="*.duckdb" --everything
git push --force
```

### 1.2 .gitignore: ✅ GOOD

The `.gitignore` file (73 lines) properly excludes:
- `__pycache__/` directories
- `.coverage` and `htmlcov/`
- `.DS_Store` files
- `.venv/` directories
- NetworkSim raw data files
- Session handoff documents

**Verification**: No excluded files are tracked in Git.

### 1.3 Git Status: ✅ CLEAN

Working tree is clean with no uncommitted changes.

## 2. Directory Structure Audit

### 2.1 Root-Level Files

| File | Status | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `README.md` | ✅ Current | Keep |
| `INSTALL.md` | ✅ Current | Keep |
| `SKILL.md` | ✅ Current | Keep |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | ✅ Current | Keep |
| `CURRENT-WORK.md` | ✅ Active | Keep |
| `SESSION-SUMMARY.md` | ⚠️ Stale (Dec 27) | Archive to docs/archive/session/ |
| `DATABASE-CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md` | ⚠️ Historical | Archive to docs/archive/migration/ |

### 2.2 Documentation Hierarchy

```
docs/
├── HEALTHSIM-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md    ✅ Current
├── HEALTHSIM-DEVELOPMENT-PROCESS.md   ✅ Current
├── CURRENT-WORK.md                    ⚠️ STALE (Dec 26 2024)
├── README.md                          ✅ Current
├── archive/                           ✅ Well-organized
├── extensions/                        ✅ Current
├── initiatives/                       ✅ Current
├── mcp/                               ✅ Current
├── skills/                            ✅ Current
└── super-prompts/                     ✅ Current
```

**Finding**: `docs/CURRENT-WORK.md` is dated December 26, 2024 while root `CURRENT-WORK.md` is December 28, 2025. The docs version is stale and should be removed or updated.

### 2.3 Package Structure: ✅ GOOD

All packages follow consistent structure:
- `packages/core/` - Shared utilities, DuckDB, state management
- `packages/mcp-server/` - MCP server implementation
- `packages/patientsim/` - PatientSim product
- `packages/membersim/` - MemberSim product
- `packages/rxmembersim/` - RxMemberSim product

**Note**: PopulationSim and NetworkSim are "skills-only" products without package directories. This is intentional as they primarily provide reference data and skills rather than Python code.

### 2.4 Skills Structure: ✅ EXCELLENT

All six products have comprehensive skills documentation:

| Product | SKILL.md Lines | Skills Count | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| PatientSim | 473 | 9 scenarios | ✅ |
| MemberSim | 566 | 8 scenarios | ✅ |
| RxMemberSim | 554 | 8 scenarios | ✅ |
| PopulationSim | 393 | 6 categories | ✅ |
| NetworkSim | 511 | 6 categories | ✅ |
| TrialSim | 538 | 15 entities | ✅ |

## 3. Database Audit

### 3.1 Current State

| Property | Value | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Location | `healthsim.duckdb` | ✅ Correct |
| Size | 1.7 GB | ✅ Expected |
| Schemas | main, population, network | ✅ All present |
| Tables | 31 total | ✅ Complete |

### 3.2 Schema Contents

**Main Schema** (21 tables, 0 records - templates):
- Entity tables ready for scenario data

**Population Schema** (5 tables, 416K+ records):
- CDC PLACES, SVI, ADI reference data

**Network Schema** (5 tables, 10.4M+ records):
- NPPES providers, facilities, quality data

---

## 4. Documentation Quality Audit

### 4.1 README Consistency: ✅ GOOD

All products have consistent README.md files:
- Product packages: ~25 lines, defer to skills/
- Skills directories: ~110-120 lines, comprehensive

### 4.2 Cross-Product Integration: ✅ EXCELLENT

All skill files document:
- PopulationSim v2.0 integration
- Cross-product data correlation
- Output format specifications
- Related skills references

### 4.3 Gaps Identified

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|----------------|
| No architecture diagram | Onboarding difficulty | Create visual diagram |
| Duplicate CURRENT-WORK.md | Confusion | Remove docs/ version |
| Root session files | Clutter | Archive |

---

## 5. Code Quality Audit

### 5.1 Test Coverage

- **Total Tests**: 716+ passing
- **Coverage Areas**: State management, auto-persist, formats, dimensional

### 5.2 Python Environment

- **Version**: Python 3.11
- **Virtual Environments**: Properly configured
- **Dependencies**: All installed via pyproject.toml

---

## 6. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Session)

1. **Archive stale root files**:
   ```bash
   mv SESSION-SUMMARY.md docs/archive/session/SESSION-SUMMARY-2024-12-27.md
   mv DATABASE-CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md docs/archive/migration/
   ```

2. **Remove stale docs/CURRENT-WORK.md**:
   ```bash
   rm docs/CURRENT-WORK.md
   ```

3. **Install Git LFS** (if not done already):
   ```bash
   brew install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   ```

### Short-Term Actions (Next Session)

1. **Clean Git history** (optional, requires coordination):
   - Migrate database to proper LFS tracking
   - Reduce .git from 9.7 GB to ~200 MB

2. **Create architecture diagram**:
   - Product relationships
   - Data flow between products
   - Cross-product integration points

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Consolidate documentation**:
   - Single source of truth for each topic
   - Clear hierarchy of docs/ subdirectories

2. **Add CI/CD**:
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Documentation generation
   - LFS verification

---

## 7. Files to Archive

The following files should be moved to `docs/archive/`:

```bash
# From root
mv SESSION-SUMMARY.md docs/archive/session/SESSION-SUMMARY-2024-12-27.md
mv DATABASE-CONSOLIDATION-COMPLETE.md docs/archive/migration/DATABASE-CONSOLIDATION-2024-12-27.md

# From docs/
rm docs/CURRENT-WORK.md  # Stale, root version is authoritative
```

---

## 8. Verification Checklist

After implementing recommendations:

- [ ] Git LFS installed and working
- [ ] Stale files archived
- [ ] Root directory cleaner
- [ ] Single CURRENT-WORK.md (at root)
- [ ] All tests still pass
