# Adding Skills

Guide to creating skills that teach Claude new domain knowledge.

## When to Add a Skill

Add a skill when **Claude needs to KNOW something** about a clinical domain, scenario, or format.

### Good Reasons to Add Skill

**New clinical domain**
```
User: "Generate a stroke patient eligible for tPA"
→ Need stroke skill with tPA criteria, NIHSS scoring, timing windows
```

**New scenario pattern**
```
User: "Generate a postpartum patient with hemorrhage"
→ Need obstetrics skill with delivery scenarios, complications
```

**Clinical guidelines**
```
User: "Generate diabetic patients following ADA guidelines"
→ Need updated diabetes skill with current treatment standards
```

**New healthcare format**
```
User: "Export to CDA format"
→ Need CDA format skill explaining structure, use cases
```

### Bad Reasons to Add Skill

**Claude needs to calculate something**
```
User: "Calculate SOFA score for this patient"
→ Don't need skill, need MCP tool to perform calculation
```

**Just parameter variations**
```
User: "Generate patient aged 70-80"
→ Don't need skill, existing generation handles age ranges
```

**One-time specific request**
```
User: "Generate patient named John Smith"
→ Don't need skill, one-off parameter
```

## Skill vs MCP Tool Decision

Use this matrix to decide between skill and MCP tool:

| Question | Skill | MCP Tool |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Does it require code execution? | No | **Yes** |
| Does it involve calculations? | No | **Yes** |
| Is it primarily knowledge? | **Yes** | No |
| Does it teach Claude "how to think"? | **Yes** | No |
| Does it require data transformation? | No | **Yes** |
| Does it enable interpretation? | **Yes** | No |
| Does it need session state? | No | **Yes** |

### Decision Examples

**Scenario: Sepsis Management**
- Question: Does it require code execution? **No**
- Question: Is it primarily knowledge? **Yes**
- Decision: **Skill**

**Scenario: SOFA Score Calculation**
- Question: Does it require calculations? **Yes**
- Question: Is it primarily knowledge? **No**
- Decision: **MCP Tool**

**Scenario: CDA Export**
- Question: Does it require data transformation? **Yes**
- Question: Does it need session state? **Yes**
- Decision: **MCP Tool** + **Skill** (to explain format)

## Skill Types

HealthSim uses three types of skills:

### 1. Domain Skills

**What:** Teach Claude about clinical specialties, conditions, or systems

**Examples:**
- Cardiology (heart disease, interventions, medications)
- Nephrology (kidney disease, dialysis, transplant)
- Obstetrics (pregnancy, delivery, postpartum)

**File location:** `skills/healthcare/[domain]-domain.md`

**When to use:** Adding a new medical specialty or organ system

### 2. Scenario Skills

**What:** Teach Claude how to generate specific patient types

**Examples:**
- Sepsis (SIRS criteria, antibiotics, timelines)
- Diabetes (HbA1c control levels, complications, regimens)
- Joint replacement (pre-op, post-op, rehab)

**File location:** `skills/scenarios/[scenario].md`

**When to use:** Adding a new patient generation pattern

### 3. Format Skills

**What:** Teach Claude about healthcare data standards

**Examples:**
- FHIR R4 (resources, references, extensions)
- HL7v2 (segments, messages, delimiters)
- MIMIC-III (tables, relationships, codes)

**File location:** `skills/formats/[format]-format.md`

**When to use:** Adding export format or data standard knowledge

```

## Skill Composition

Skills can reference other skills to avoid duplication:

### Referencing Patterns

**In a scenario skill referencing domain knowledge:**

```markdown
## Domain Knowledge

### Cardiac Medications

For detailed cardiac medication information, see the [Cardiology Domain Skill](../healthcare/cardiology-domain.md#medications).

**Quick reference for this scenario:**
- Aspirin 325mg loading, then 81mg daily
- Clopidogrel 600mg loading, then 75mg daily
- Atorvastatin 80mg daily (high-intensity statin)
```

**In a domain skill referencing scenarios:**

```markdown
## Common Scenarios

This domain knowledge supports several scenario skills:

- **[Acute MI](../scenarios/acute-mi.md)** - Myocardial infarction management
- **[Heart Failure](../scenarios/heart-failure.md)** - Acute decompensated HF
- **[Arrhythmias](../scenarios/arrhythmias.md)** - Atrial fibrillation, VTach, etc.

Refer to those skills for specific generation patterns.
```

### Composition Benefits

- Avoid duplicating medication lists
- Single source of truth for lab ranges
- Easy to update (change once, affects all)
- Claude sees connections between skills

## Testing Skills

### Step 1: Add to Claude Project

```bash
# In Claude Desktop or Claude.ai
1. Open HealthSim project
2. Add skill file to Project Knowledge
3. Refresh project context
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Request

```
User: "Generate [scenario] patient"

Expected: Claude generates patient matching skill guidelines
Verify:
- Correct demographics
- Appropriate conditions
- Realistic medications
- Valid lab values
- Proper timeline
```

### Step 3: Test Variations

```
User: "Generate [scenario] patient with [complication]"

Expected: Claude adds complication appropriately
Verify:
- Complication matches clinical pattern
- Labs/vitals adjusted appropriately
- Treatment reflects complication
```

### Step 4: Test Edge Cases

```
User: "Generate severe [scenario] patient"
User: "Generate [scenario] patient presenting late"
User: "Generate [scenario] patient with multiple complications"

Expected: Claude handles severity/timing/complexity correctly
```

### Step 5: Verify Skill Usage

Ask Claude:

```
User: "What skills did you use to generate that patient?"

Expected: Claude should mention your new skill
```

### Step 6: Test Knowledge Retention

```
User: "Why did you choose those medications?"
User: "What's the normal range for that lab value?"
User: "What complications should I watch for?"

Expected: Claude answers from skill knowledge
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Severity Spectrum

Many scenarios have mild/moderate/severe variants:

```markdown
## Generation Guidelines

### Severity Levels

**Mild [Condition]:**
- Presentation: [mild symptoms]
- Labs: [mildly abnormal ranges]
- Treatment: [conservative management]

**Moderate [Condition]:**
- Presentation: [moderate symptoms]
- Labs: [more abnormal ranges]
- Treatment: [standard therapy]

**Severe [Condition]:**
- Presentation: [severe symptoms, complications]
- Labs: [severely abnormal ranges]
- Treatment: [intensive management, ICU]

**Example Requests:**
"Generate mild [condition] patient" → Use mild guidelines
"Generate severe [condition] patient" → Use severe guidelines
```

### Pattern 2: Temporal Progression

Some conditions have early/late or acute/chronic phases:

```markdown
## Generation Guidelines

### Timeline Variations

**Early Presentation (< [timeframe]):**
- [Early phase characteristics]
- [Treatment options available]
- [Prognosis considerations]

**Late Presentation (> [timeframe]):**
- [Late phase characteristics]
- [Limited treatment options]
- [Complications more likely]

**Example Requests:**
"Generate [condition] patient presenting within [window]" → Early
"Generate [condition] patient presenting [late]" → Late
```

### Pattern 3: Complication Patterns

Structure complications systematically:

```markdown
## Generation Guidelines

### Complications

**Common Complications (30-50%):**
- [Complication 1]: [description, management]
- [Complication 2]: [description, management]

**Serious Complications (5-10%):**
- [Complication 3]: [description, management]
- [Complication 4]: [description, management]

**Rare Complications (<5%):**
- [Complication 5]: [description, management]

**Example Requests:**
"Generate [condition] with [common complication]" → Apply complication pattern
"Generate [condition] with [rare complication]" → Ensure clinical plausibility
```
