# Generative Framework Implementation Progress

**Initiative**: Profile/Distribution/Journey Execution Framework  
**Started**: 2026-01-04  
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress

---

## Overview

Implementing the Generative Framework to close gaps between design documentation and working functionality. This enables data-driven generation with profiles, distributions, and journeys across all HealthSim products.

### Key Documents
- Design: `HEALTHSIM-GENERATIVE-FRAMEWORK-CONCEPTS.md`
- Specification: `HEALTHSIM-PROFILE-BUILDER-SPECIFICATION.md`
- Taxonomy: `HEALTHSIM-GENERATIVE-TAXONOMY.md`
- Decisions: `HEALTHSIM-GENERATIVE-FRAMEWORK-DECISIONS.md`

## Phase 1: Core Distribution Execution (Foundation)

### Task 1.1: Audit Existing Generation Skills ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Review `skills/generation/SKILL.md` - Well structured, good triggers
- [x] Review `skills/generation/builders/profile-builder.md` - Comprehensive, conversation flow defined
- [x] Review `skills/generation/builders/journey-builder.md` - Exists
- [x] Review `skills/generation/distributions/distribution-types.md` - Good reference, 6 types documented

- [x] Document gaps and needed enhancements

**Audit Findings:**
- Core Python module exists: `packages/core/src/healthsim/generation/`
- Implemented: WeightedChoice, NormalDistribution, UniformDistribution, AgeDistribution
- MISSING: LogNormalDistribution, ExplicitDistribution, ConditionalDistribution
- SeedManager exists but not hierarchical

## Phase 3: Journey Execution Enhancement

### Task 3.1: Review MemberSim Scenario Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Document existing engine capabilities
- [x] Identify reusable patterns
- [x] Plan cross-product port strategy

**MemberSim ScenarioEngine Analysis:**
- Location: `packages/membersim/src/membersim/scenarios/engine.py`
- Clean separation: ScenarioDefinition → ScenarioEngine → MemberTimeline
- Handler registration pattern for event types
- Condition evaluation with context
- Dependency-based event scheduling (depends_on)
- Delay handling with timedelta conversion

**Reusable Patterns:**
1. Event handler registration (pluggable handlers by type)
2. Context building for condition evaluation
3. Timeline execution up to a date
4. Dependency-based scheduling

**Port Strategy:**
- Move core engine logic to `packages/core/src/healthsim/generation/journey_engine.py`
- Keep product-specific handlers in product packages
- Abstract EventType to be extensible per product

### Task 3.2: Create Shared Journey Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Move core engine to packages/core - journey_engine.py created
- [x] Abstract product-specific handlers - EventHandler protocol
- [x] Create journey specification schema - JourneySpecification, EventDefinition
- [x] Implement timeline generation - Timeline, TimelineEvent
- [x] Add event scheduling - Dependency-based with delays
- [x] Add conditional branching - EventCondition with operators
- [x] Add tests - 27 tests pass

**New Module: `journey_engine.py` (700+ lines)**
- Event types: BaseEventType, PatientEventType, MemberEventType, RxEventType, TrialEventType
- Timing: DelaySpec with fixed/uniform/normal distributions
- Conditions: EventCondition with operators (eq, gt, in, etc.)
- Specification: JourneySpecification, EventDefinition, TriggerSpec
- Execution: JourneyEngine, Timeline, TimelineEvent
- Templates: JOURNEY_TEMPLATES (diabetic-first-year, new-member-onboarding)

### Task 3.3: Cross-Domain Trigger System ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Design trigger specification format - RegisteredTrigger, TriggerSpec
- [x] Implement trigger evaluation - TriggerRegistry.fire_triggers()
- [x] Implement cross-product event dispatch - CrossProductCoordinator
- [x] Add delay/timing handling - DelaySpec integration
- [x] Add tests - 13 tests pass

**New Module: `triggers.py` (470+ lines)**
- TriggerRegistry - Manages source→target trigger mappings
- RegisteredTrigger - Single trigger definition
- TriggerPriority - IMMEDIATE, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW
- CrossProductCoordinator - Orchestrates linked entities
- LinkedEntity - Entity with cross-product IDs and timelines
- Default healthcare triggers registered (diagnosis→claim, med→fill, etc.)

### Task 3.4: Product-Specific Handlers ⏸️ DEFERRED
Product-specific handlers will be implemented incrementally as each product
is enhanced to use the shared journey engine. Core infrastructure is ready.

- [ ] PatientSim event handlers (ADT, orders, results)
- [ ] MemberSim event handlers (enrollment, claims) - Has existing ScenarioEngine
- [ ] RxMemberSim event handlers (fills, reversals)
- [ ] TrialSim event handlers (visits, AEs)
