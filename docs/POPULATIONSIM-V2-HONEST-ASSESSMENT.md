# PopulationSim v2.0 Implementation - Honest Assessment

**Created**: 2024-12-23  
**Purpose**: Provide an accurate evaluation of completed vs planned work for handoff

---

## Executive Summary

**Bottom line**: Sessions 1-4 appear to be solidly implemented. Sessions 5-8 received surface-level updates (SKILL.md cross-references) but NOT the deep integration originally planned.

---

## What Was Planned (8 Sessions)

### Sessions 1-4: PopulationSim Foundation
- Embed 148 MB of CDC/Census data into the repository
- Create data-access skills for lookups
- Build geographic, SDOH, health-patterns skill categories
- Create canonical model with per-field provenance

### Sessions 5-8: Cross-Product Integration
- **Session 5 (PatientSim)**: Create new skills for data-driven patient generation
  - `patient-demographics.md` - Generate patients matching real tract demographics
  - `condition-prevalence.md` - Use PLACES rates for condition assignment
  - `sdoh-factors.md` - Incorporate real SVI/ADI into patient context
  
- **Session 6 (MemberSim + RxMemberSim)**: Deep actuarial integration
  - `member-demographics.md` - Real population distributions
  - `risk-stratification.md` - HCC scoring based on actual prevalence
  - `adherence-patterns.md` - SDOH-based adherence modeling
  
- **Session 7 (TrialSim)**: Evidence-based trial planning
  - Site selection using real prevalence data
  - Diversity planning with actual demographic data
  - Enrollment projections grounded in CDC data
  
- **Session 8 (Documentation)**: Comprehensive examples and testing

## What Actually Got Done

### Sessions 1-4: ✅ SOLIDLY COMPLETE

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Data package (148 MB) | ✅ Done | `skills/populationsim/data/` contains all files |
| data-access skills | ✅ Done | `data-lookup.md`, `geography-lookup.md`, `data-aggregation.md` |
| geographic skills | ✅ Done | `county-profile.md`, `census-tract-analysis.md`, etc. |
| sdoh skills | ✅ Done | `svi-analysis.md`, `adi-analysis.md`, etc. |
| health-patterns skills | ✅ Done | `chronic-disease-prevalence.md`, etc. |
| Canonical model v2.0 | ✅ Done | `population-profile-schema.md` with provenance |
| Data dictionary | ✅ Done | `data/README.md` (367 lines) |

**Commits**: fba1978, e3b9e21, 33c6baf

### Sessions 5-8: ⚠️ SURFACE-LEVEL ONLY

| What Was Planned | What Actually Happened |
|------------------|------------------------|
| New PatientSim skills for data-driven generation | Found `data-integration.md` already existed (from prior session). Added v2.0 boilerplate to SKILL.md. **No new scenario skills created.** |
| MemberSim actuarial integration | Replaced ~15 lines in SKILL.md with ~100 lines of v2.0 cross-references. **No new skills created.** |
| RxMemberSim adherence modeling | Same - SKILL.md update only. **No new skills created.** |
| TrialSim site selection skills | Same - SKILL.md update only. **No new skills created.** |
| Comprehensive hello-healthsim examples | Added brief v2.0 blurbs to 3 existing files. **No new examples created.** |

## Specific Gaps

### PatientSim

**Exists**: 
- `skills/patientsim/data-integration.md` - Foundation skill (decent, ~280 lines)
- SKILL.md has v2.0 cross-product section

**Missing**:
- No `patient-demographics.md` that actually reads from embedded data
- No `condition-prevalence.md` that uses PLACES rates
- No `sdoh-factors.md` for incorporating SVI/ADI
- Scenario skills (diabetes-management.md, heart-failure.md, etc.) NOT updated to use data

### MemberSim

**Exists**:
- SKILL.md has v2.0 section with examples

**Missing**:
- No `member-demographics.md` skill
- No `risk-stratification.md` using real prevalence
- Plan-benefits.md, enrollment-eligibility.md NOT updated

### RxMemberSim

**Exists**:
- SKILL.md has v2.0 section with adherence modeling concepts

**Missing**:
- No `adherence-patterns.md` skill
- retail-pharmacy.md, dur-alerts.md NOT updated

### TrialSim

**Exists**:
- SKILL.md has v2.0 section
- `trial-support/` skills exist in PopulationSim

**Missing**:
- TrialSim skills don't actually READ from embedded data files
- No working examples of data-driven site selection

### Documentation

**Exists**:
- Brief v2.0 mentions in 3 hello-healthsim files

**Missing**:
- No comprehensive worked examples showing data lookup → generation
- No testing documentation
- No validation that any of this actually works end-to-end

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Accept Current State
The SKILL.md cross-references provide enough documentation that Claude COULD figure out how to use the embedded data when generating. It just hasn't been rigorously tested or formalized into dedicated skills.

### Option B: Complete the Integration Properly
1. Create actual `patient-demographics.md` that reads from CSV files
2. Update scenario skills (diabetes, heart-failure, etc.) with data lookup patterns
3. Build working examples that demonstrate end-to-end flow
4. Test with real prompts and verify outputs match expected rates

### Option C: Prioritize Testing
Before creating more skills, test whether the current documentation enables Claude to correctly:
- Look up Harris County diabetes rate (should return 12.1%)
- Generate patients with demographics matching county profile
- Apply SDOH factors based on SVI scores
