# HealthSim Workspace

**Synthetic healthcare data generation through natural language conversation.**

HealthSim generates realistic, clinically coherent healthcare data for testing, training, and development—from simple patient records to complete care journeys spanning clinical, claims, pharmacy, and clinical trial domains.

## Generative Framework

For large-scale data generation, HealthSim provides a **specification-driven framework** that separates what you want from how it's generated:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Profile Builder** | Define population characteristics | "200 Medicare diabetics age 65-85 in Texas" |
| **Journey Builder** | Define event sequences over time | "First year diabetes journey with quarterly visits" |
| **Templates** | Pre-built common scenarios | Medicare Diabetic, Surgical Episode, New Member Onboarding |
| **Executors** | Generate data from specifications | Deterministic, reproducible output |

### Quick Examples

**Profile-Driven Generation:**
```
Build a profile for 100 commercial members:
- Age 25-45
- Mix of healthy and chronic conditions
- Urban geography

Execute the profile
```

**Template + Journey:**
```
Use the Medicare diabetic template with the diabetic first-year journey for 50 patients
```

### Resources

| [Profile Templates](skills/generation/templates/profiles/) | Pre-built population profiles |

## Cross-Product Integration

HealthSim products work together to generate complete healthcare data journeys:

```
Person (Base Identity - SSN as universal correlator)
   │
   ├── PatientSim → Patient → Clinical encounters, labs, meds
   │        ↓
   ├── MemberSim → Member → Claims, adjudication, accumulators  
   │        ↓
   ├── RxMemberSim → RxMember → Pharmacy claims, DUR, formulary
   │
   └── TrialSim → Subject → Protocol visits, AEs, efficacy (if enrolled)

   NetworkSim provides: Providers, facilities, pharmacies for all products
   PopulationSim provides: Demographics, health rates, SDOH for all products
```

**Example: Heart Failure Patient Journey**

| Day | Product | Event | Output |
|-----|---------|-------|--------|
| 0 | PatientSim | ED visit, HF diagnosis | Encounter, labs, meds |
| 3 | PatientSim | Inpatient discharge | Discharge summary |
| 5 | MemberSim | Facility claim | 837I (DRG 291) |
| 3 | RxMemberSim | Discharge Rx fills | NCPDP claims |
| 30 | PatientSim | Cardiology follow-up | Office encounter |
| 32 | MemberSim | Professional claim | 837P (99214) |

## State Management

HealthSim persists your generated data to DuckDB, allowing you to build scenarios over multiple sessions and query them without regenerating.

### Two Approaches: Full Data vs. Auto-Persist

**Full Data** is best when you have a small scenario (under 50 entities) and want everything loaded at once. Claude sees all the data in context and can reference it directly.

**Auto-Persist** is best when you're generating larger datasets (50+ entities). Instead of flooding the conversation with hundreds of JSON objects, HealthSim saves them quietly and gives you a compact summary. When you need specific data, you query for just what you need.

| Approach | Best For | What Happens |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Full Data** | Small scenarios, interactive exploration | All entities loaded into conversation |
| **Auto-Persist** | Large batches, production datasets | Summary in conversation, data in database |

### Conversation Examples

**Full Data Approach** (small scenarios):

```
You: Generate 5 diabetes patients for my demo

Claude: [Generates patients with full details]

Here are 5 diabetes patients:
1. Maria Santos, 58F, Type 2 DM, A1C 7.8%, on Metformin...
2. James Wilson, 67M, Type 2 DM with CKD...
[full details for all 5]

You: Save these as "demo-cohort"

Claude: Saved "demo-cohort" with 5 patients.

You: Load my demo cohort

Claude: [Full patient data appears in conversation]
```

**Auto-Persist Approach** (large scenarios):

```
You: Generate 200 Medicare members over 65

Claude: Generated and saved "medicare-members-20241228":
- 200 members persisted
- Age range: 65-89
- Gender: 48% male, 52% female
- Top states: CA, TX, FL

[Data is in database, not flooding the conversation]

You: Show me members from California

Claude: Found 42 California members:

| Name | Age | County | Risk Score |
|------|-----|--------|------------|
| Margaret Chen | 72 | Los Angeles | 1.85 |
| Robert Williams | 68 | San Diego | 1.12 |
...
Showing 20 of 42. Say "show more" for next page.

You: How many have diabetes?

Claude: [Queries database]
67 members (34%) have a diabetes diagnosis.
```

### Benefits

- **Session continuity** - Save work at end of day, resume tomorrow
- **Scenario library** - Build reusable cohorts for demos and testing
- **Context efficiency** - Generate thousands of entities without context overflow
- **Targeted queries** - Find exactly what you need without loading everything

### Under the Hood

State management uses the `healthsim-mcp` server which provides tools for saving, loading, querying, and managing scenarios in DuckDB. You don't need to know the tool names—just ask Claude naturally to save, load, or query your data.

## Setup

**📖 [Complete Installation Guide](INSTALL.md)** - Detailed instructions for Git LFS, Python, DuckDB, and Claude integration.

### Quick Setup

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Git LFS** | 3.0+ | **Required** for database files |
| Git | 2.0+ | Clone repository |
| Python | 3.10+ | For healthsim-core package |
| Claude Desktop or Claude Code | Latest | AI conversation interface |

### Git LFS (Required)

HealthSim uses Git Large File Storage for the database. Install before cloning:

```bash
# macOS
brew install git-lfs && git lfs install

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install git-lfs && git lfs install

# See INSTALL.md for Windows and troubleshooting
```

### Python Environment

```bash
# Clone and setup (Git LFS downloads database automatically)
git clone https://github.com/mark64oswald/healthsim-workspace.git
cd healthsim-workspace

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install healthsim-core (includes DuckDB)
cd packages/core
pip install -e .
```

**DuckDB** is bundled with healthsim-core - no separate installation required. The database (`healthsim.duckdb`, ~1.7 GB) is automatically downloaded via Git LFS and ready to use.

**Important:** If the database file is missing or tiny (~500 bytes), Git LFS didn't download it. Run `git lfs pull` to download manually. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.

### Claude Desktop (Recommended)

Add to a Claude Project or configure as MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthsim": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/healthsim-workspace"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```bash
cd healthsim-workspace
claude
```

See [hello-healthsim/](hello-healthsim/) for detailed setup instructions.
